Version 2.5.0 release notes
===========================
TODO:

Version 2.4.4 release notes
===========================
DMTCP now supports InfiniBand UD (in addition to the more common InfiniBand
RC).  This is becoming necessary, now that many MPI implementations are
typically configured to use both InfiniBand RC and InfiniBand UD.

Other major bug fixes include:

* A regression in the multi-arch installation has been fixed.  It should
  again be possible to configure DMTCP to support a mixture of 32- and
  64-bit applications as documented in the `doc/multi-arch.txt` and in
  the DMTCP FAQ.
* A race condition was fixed that could cause a failure to restart after
  many checkpoint-restart cycles  (i.e., a restart from a checkpoint of
  a restart from a checkpoint, etc.).  This race condition potentially
  happened primarily for programs that were continually creating and
  destroying many threads or continually using `mmap` to create and destroy
  many BSD-style shared memory regions among different processes.
* The `dmtcp_set_coord_ckpt_dir("dirname")` utility in dmtcp.h (for DMTCP plugins)
  now also supports relative pathnames for `"dirname"`.
* The `dmtcp.h` file now uses the macro `DMTCP_VOID` instead of the macro `VOID`.
  This avoids name clashes with user include files that also define a
  macro `VOID`.
* The `modify-env` plugin has raised the maximum size of `"dmtcp_env.txt"`
  to over 12,000 bytes (and warns if a still larger size is used).
* Some additional utilities in `dmtcp.h` for DMTCP plugins, that were
  labelled "FOR EXPERTS ONLY" are now directly supported without
  modification of the DMTCP source code.
* An improved error message is provided when a target application
  launched with `dmtcp_launch --no-coordinator` tries to use `fork`.
  (Fork creates a second process, and a DMTCP coordinator is needed when
  there is more than one process.)

Version 2.4.3 release notes
===========================
This is primarily a bug-fix release and includes the following changes:

* Added support for CMA (Cross-Memory Attach:
  process_vm_readv/process_vm_writev).
* Fixed a regression affecting dmtcp_checkpoint() [applic-initiated ckpt API].
* Fixed a compilation error on RHEL-5.8.
* Some smaller bug fixes.

Version 2.4.2 release notes
===========================
This is primarily a bug fix release. The following bugs were fixed:

* Fixed interval checkpoint.
* Fix for `dmtcp_launch --no-coordinator`.
* Support for `sched_*` functions.
* Build fix for `--enable-debug` compilation flag.
* Compilation fixes for Clang-3.4.

Version 2.4.1 release notes
===========================
* In 2.4.0, deleted backing files for mmap-style shared memory were not properly
  supported on restart
* Sys V SHM: fix potential interference by another plugin during ckpt


Version 2.4 release notes
=========================
Several important changes and enhancements were added:
* dmtcp_launch/restart/command/coordinator now take the flags
    -h, -p, --coord-host/port and environment variables
    DMTCP_COORD_HOST/PORT.  The older --host, --port, DMTCP_HOST/PORT
    are now deprecated.
* Newer versions of MATLAB (matlab-2013 and later) were using additional
   Linux features.  All recent versions of matlab are again supported.
* Intensive testing done for integration of MPI/SLURM
   for the following MPI dialects:  Intel MPI/MVAPICH-2/MPICH-2/Open MPI.
   See plugin/batch-queue/job_examples/ for SLURM/DMTCP submission scripts.
   Preliminary support for some other resource managers also provided,
   especially including ibrun.
 - Open MPI version 1.8 _with_ InfiniBand is not yet supported.
     This is due to the OMPI use of UD (unreliable datagrams) for InfiniBand.
     Support is planned for the near future.  Earlier OMPI versions continue
     to work with IB.  We do not currently know of a config in OMPI-1.8 to
     avoid IB/UD (to use only IB/CM).  Such a workaround would let DMTCP work.
* Added support for newest Linux kernels: split of [vdso]
   into [vdso] and [vvar]; To see if this affects you, do:
     cat /proc/self/maps | grep '\[vvar]'
* Support for glibc version 2.21 added.  To see if this affects you, do:
     ls -l /lib*/libc.so.6 /lib/*/libc.so.6
* The environment variable DMTCP_GDB_ATTACH_ON_RESTART was added.  Setting
     this permanently is a security risk. But on a temporary basis,
     it can enable easier debugging of restarted processes:
       DMTCP_GDB_ATTACH_ON_RESTART=1 dmtcp_restart ckpt_a.out_*.dmtcp &
       gdb a.out `pgrep -n a.out`
* Enhancements added for newer 32-bit ARM (armv7) CPUs
* Experimental support is now provided for 64-bit ARM (armv8)
* Bug fixes

Version 2.3.1 release notes
=========================
This is primarily a bug fix release that contains several minor bug fixes.

Version 2.3 release notes
=========================
This is primarily a bug fix release.  However, if you are using DMTCP
for the ARM v7 CPU, or if you are using DMTCP either with the InfiniBand
network or with the SLURM batch system, then it is strongly recommended
to upgrade.

The primary changes for this release are:
* Bug fix affecting building for ARM on some recent armv7a CPUs.
* Improvements in support for InfiniBand network and for SLURM
  batch system.
* Other smaller bug fixes.

Version 2.2.1 release notes
=========================
This is a bug fix release. The previous release had a bug when configured
with --enable-unique-checkpoint-filenames configure flag. This has been fixed
now. Users relying on this flag are highly recommended to upgrade to 2.2.1.

Version 2.2 release notes
=========================
In this release, the lowest layers have been re-organized and partially
re-written for greater clarity of code and greater maintainability.
These changes should be transparent to end users.

Users relying on the use of DMTCP with MPI, InfiniBand or the Toruqe or
SLURM batch queues are strongly advised to upgrade.

Other changes are:
* A --exit-after-ckpt flag was added for dmtcp_coordinator.
* Scalability improvements were added.  DMTCP has now been tested
  on an MPI jobs using 2048 MPI ranks over 2048  CPU cores.
* Anybody using DMTCP with InfiniBand is strongly recommended to upgrade
  to inherit important bug fixes.  The InfiniBand plugin is still
  formally part of the 'contrib' directory during this release.  It was
  tested primarily against Open MPI.  Further testing is still needed
  before the InfiniBand plugin can be promoted from the 'contrib'
  directory to the 'plugin' directory.
* The --infiniband flag of dmtcp_launch was not fully functional in
  version 2.1.  This is now fixed.
* The 'dmtcp_launch --no-coordinator' option was broken in version 2.1.
  This is now fixed.
* The --disable-dl-plugin flag was added to dmtcp_launch.  Most users will
  not need this option.  But software relying on DT_RPATH, DT_RUNPATH,
  or certain other uncommon cases in loading dynamic libraries may need
  to invoke this for stability.  It is hoped to remove the need for this
  flag in a future release.
* A similar comment holds for the --disable-alloc-plugin flag in dmtcp_launch.
  If there appear to be issues with a memory allocator, consider invoking
  this flag.
* Numerous minor bug fixes and enhancements were added.

Version 2.1 release notes
=========================

* DMTCP version 2.1. has now been released.  As before, it runs on most
  Linux distros, and supports both x86 and x86_64 (Intel/AMD for 32- and
  64-bits), and 32-bit ARM (ARMv7).  In addition, the older DMTCP version 1.2.x
  (currently 1.2.8) continues to be maintained, but on a bug-fix basis only.

* CHANGE NEEDED FOR ALL PLUGINS:
  - If you have plugins that include "dmtcpplugin.h", they will now have to be
    changed to include "dmtcp.h".  This is to reflect that "dmtcp.h" has more
    uses than just for plugins.

* This new release includes:
  - some newly stable plugins - batch-queue, modify-env, ptrace (see below)
  - full support for 32-/64-bit multilib architecture. (see below)
  - other enhancements to the core feature set (see below)
  - adapting DMTCP to application requirements:  removal of the old dmtcpaware
    interface in favor of the newer interface:  test/plugin/applic-*ckpt/
    (see below)
  - attempt to restore current working directory on restart (may be impossible
    if restart host has different filesystem)
  - 'dmtcp_coordinator --port-file <FILE>' causes coordinator to write the port
  - number on which it listens into FILE.  This is useful in
    conjunction with 'dmtcp_coordinator --port 0', which starts a coordinator
    at a random unused port.
  - 'dmtcp_restart --ckptdir <DIR>' and 'dmtcp_restart_script.sh --ckptdir <DIR>'
    will change to a new directory to hold checkpoint images on restart.
  - 'dmtcp_restart --no-strict-uid-checking'
    or 'dmtcp_coordinator --no-strict-uid-checking'
    [ allows a user with a different uid to restart a checkpoint image;
    process uid will be changed to that of the new user ]
  - './configure --enable-run-as-root'  [ self explanatory; normally running
    as root is bad practice ]
  - a new internal plugin to handle 'ssh' uniformly; Some corner cases
    in checkpointing MPI could have been affected by this.
  - some bug fixes related to the new plugin software architecture initiated
    with DMTCP 2.0

* SOME NEWLY STABLE PLUGINS:
  This release continues to emphasize the use of DMTCP plugins.
  The plugins are now organized into two top-level subdirectories:
  - plugin - plugin is built by './configure; make', but must be invoked,
             typically through command-line option of 'dmtcp_launch'
  - contrib - plugin not built; user must cd to the subdirectory of the plugin,
              build it, and invoke it with 'dmtcp_launch --with-plugin ...'

  - Plugins in the top-level plugin directory:
    + ptrace :  'dmtcp_launch --ptrace'
        a plugin to support checkpointing ptrace-based applications,
        notably including GDB.
    + batch-queue :  'dmtcp_launch --batch-queue'
        a resource manager plugin that supports the Torque/PBS and SLURM
        batch queue systems.  (This plugin is now mature, and was renamed
        from 'rm' in DMTCP-2.0 to 'batch-queue' to better reflect its use.)
        [ improved in DMTCP 2.1 ]
    + modify-env :  'dmtcp_launch --modify-env'
        Normally, on dmtcp_restart, a process can see only the original
        environment variables in effect during dmtcp_launch or set by the
        process itself.  It is common to wish to update these environment
        variables based on the environment on the restart host
        (e.g., DISPLAY=$DISPLAY).  This can be set in a file dmtcp_env.txt .
        [ new in DMTCP 2.1 ]

  - The contrib plugins include:
    + condor : support for HTCondor, a framework for high throughput computing
    + kvm : checkpointing of a KVM virtual machine
    + tun : support for tun networking (as in Tun/Tap) between a virtual
        machine and the host machine
    + python : support for checkpoint/restart within a Python session
    + infiniband : checkpointing over InfiniBand networks supports OFED
        InfiniBand API.
        (Note: If you are using a newer release of OFED, you may wish to use
         the rewrite of this plugin, to be available from the svn in late
         January, 2014.)
      [ improved in DMTCP 2.1 ]
    + ib2tcp : support for checkpointing computation over InfiniBand and
        restarting over TCP.
      [ new in DMTCP 2.1 ]
    + ckptfile : example/template for a plugin to change the default directory
        to receive checkpoint images.  This can be important when restarting on
        a new host.
      [ new in DMTCP 2.1 ]

* FULL SUPPORT FOR 32-/64-bit MULTILIB ARCHITECTURE:

  The standard binary, dmtcp_launch, now supports both 32- and 64-bit programs.
  Further, a 64-bit program may invoke a 32-bit program and vice versa, as part
  of a single computation under DMTCP control.

* OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO THE CORE FEATURE SET:

  - For extremely malloc-intensive programs, run-time overhead from several
      per cent to 20% has been observed.  This is due to DMTCP deadlock
      avoidance.  (The glibc implementation of malloc uses a global lock,
      that can result in deadlock if a user invokes malloc inside a plugin
      during checkpoint or restart.)  If a user program is not using malloc
      in a plugin during checkpoint, then the user can disable this
      DMTCP deadlock avoidance scheme with a flag:
        dmtcp_launch --disable-alloc-plugin
      A future modification to DMTCP may remove this issue entirely.

* ADAPTING DMTCP TO APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND TO EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENTS:

  The old 'dmtcpaware' API is being removed in favor of:
    test/plugin/applic-*ckpt/

  For details on this newer API, please read the QUICK-START file with this
  same heading:  ADAPTING DMTCP TO ...

Version 2.0 release notes
=========================

This version 2.0 release represents the future of DMTCP.  The older DMTCP
version 1.2.x branch will continue to be maintained for bug fixes and
back-porting of simple enhancements to DMTCP, in order to provide backward
compatibility.  But DMTCP version 1.2.x will not see most new features.


DMTCP version 2.0 has been re-designed around the concept of DMTCP
plugins (similar in spirit to web browser plugins).  Much of the internal
architecture of DMTCP has been moved into plugins, for greater modularity.
Further, the plugin capability has been exposed, to make it easy for end
users to write their own plugins.  Among the capabilities of plugins are:

* the ability for user code to initiate or delay a checkpoint;
* the ability for user code to take special actions at the time
  of checkpoint, resume, or restart (for example, disconnect from
  a database at checkpoint time, and re-connect at restart time);
* the ability of user code to virtualize ids and other interfaces
  (for example virtualize global ids to data objects, in case they
   change between the time of checkpoint and restart);

For details on how to use plugins, see:

* http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/plugin-tutorial.pdf
  and the examples in:
* http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/test/plugin/

Other changes in this new DMTCP 2.0 branch include:

* The command dmtcp_checkpoint has been renamed to dmtcp_launch.
  The older dmtcp_checkpoint is still supported for backwards compatibility,
  but deprecated.
* Checkpointing of ssh connections is now more general and much more robust.
  This may improve the robustness of DMTCP in checkpointing certain
  dialects of MPI with unusual cluster configurations.  (The newer support
  for ssh is based on an internal DMTCP plugin.)
* There is now a contrib directory with support for several extensions to
  DMTCP.
  Note that many of these extensions represent new code that has not yet
  been thoroughly tested.  Feedback is welcome.
    - Checkpointing of KVM virtual machines from the outside, without
        the need for KVM-specific snapshots (contrib/kvm)
    - checkpoint of network of KVM virtual machines (contrib/tun with
        contrib/kvm)
    - plugin support both for Torque and SLURM batch queues (resource managers)
	(contrib/torque and contrib/rm)
    - integrated support for calling DMTCP from inside Python (contrib/python)
    - support for checkpointing over InfiniBand (contrib/infiniband)
    [ Note that this code is very new and is probably less than robust.
      Feedback is very welcome, as we work on a future, improved version. ]
    - support for checkpointing within Condor (contrib/condor)
    [ This support was available for some years, but is now collected
      into contrib. ]

Version 1.2.8 release notes
===========================

DMTCP version 1.2.8 is primarily a bug fix release.  It is particularly
recommended to upgrade if you are using DMTCP with the ARM CPU,
or if you will compile DMTCP with a C++11 compiler (e.g. GNU flag -std=c++11).

Important changes include:

* Bug fixes for newer ARM CPUs --- especially addressing cache coherency
   issues of multi-core ARM, and the more aggressive out-of-order
   execution for newer ARM CPUs.
* On restart, gzip zombie processes associated with compressed checkpoint
   images were not always reaped properly.  This is now handled correctly.
* Peliminary support for using C++11 compilers to compile DMTCP (but
   not yet intensively tested).
* Minor bug fixes.

Version 1.2.7 release notes
===========================

- Proper restore of sockets calling bind with port '0'.
- Allow plugins to call system() etc. during pre-ckpt phase.
- Several other bug fixes and performance improvements


Version 1.2.6 release notes
===========================

- Previous release (1.2.5) introduced compilation errors for older kernels.
This release fixes them.
- Several minor bug fixes related to gcc 4.7.


Version 1.2.5 release notes
===========================

- epoll, eventfd, and signalfd are now supported
- The ARM architecture for Linux is now supported.
  (Linux currently supports 32-bit ARM EABI.)
- The name "DMTCP module" is changed to "DMTCP plugin" (more common
  terminology).  User plugins can greatly customize the behavior of DMTCP.
- The dmtcp_checkpoint cmd was resetting the checkpoint interval even if the
  user did not specify the -i/--interval flag.  This is now fixed.
- Improved support for a planned Fedora package for DMTCP
- On resume from ckpt, zero pages were sometimes expanded (increasing the
  memory footprint).  This affected Java.  This is now fixed.
- Some bug fixes were provided for programs that intensively create and destroy
  threads (e.g. OpenMP, Java)
- After restart, the floating point rounding mode (fesetround) was not being
  properly restored.  This is now fixed.
- There have been requests for support of DMTCP for PBS/TORQUE.  Some partial
  support has now been added to the svn only (_not_ to this release).
  Please write to us if you need this support from DMTCP.
- The FAQ at the DMTCP web site was expanded.
- 15% slowdown observed in an unusual case:
  A user reports that if your program frequently does both of these:
  a.  is heavily multi-threaded; and
  b.  calls malloc/free intensively;
  This has been diagnosed.  It was seen too close to this 1.2.5 release, and so
  the fix will be provided for the next release (and in the public svn).

Version 1.2.4 release notes
===========================

- There is now much more robust treatment of processes that rapidly create and
  destroy threads.  This was the case for the Java JVM (both for OpenJDK and
  Oracle (Sun) Java).  This was also the case for Cilk.  Cilk++ was not tested.
  We believe this new DMTCP to now be highly robust -- and we would appreciate
  receiving a notification if you find a Java or Cilk program that is not
  compatible with DMTCP.
- Zero-mapped pages are no longer expanded and saved to the DMTCP checkpoint
  image.  For Java programs (and other programs using zero-mapped pages for
  their allocation arena or garbage collecotr), the checkpoint image will now
  be much smaller.  Checkpoint and restart times will also be faster.
- DMTCP_ROOT/dmtcp/doc directory added with documentation of some DMTCP
  internals.  architecture-of-dmtcp.pdf is a good place to start reading for
  those who are curious.
- The directory of example modules was moved to DMTCP_ROOT/test/module.  This
  continues to support third-part wrappers around system calls, can registering
  functions to be called by DMTCP at interesting times (like pre-checkpoint,
  post-resume, post-restart, new thread created, etc.).
- This version of MTCP (inside this package) should be compatible with the
  checkpoint-restart service of Open MPI.  The usage will be documented soon
  through the Open MPI web site.  As before, an alternative is to simply start
  Open MPI inside DMTCP, and let DMTCP treat all of Open MPI as a "black box"
  that happens to be a distributed computation
- A new --prefix command line flag has been added to dmtcp_checkpoint.  It
  operates similarly to the flag of the same name in Open MPI.  For distributed
  computations, remote processes will use the prefix as part of the path to
  find the remote dmtcp_checkpoint command.  This is useful when a gateway
  machine has a different directory structure from the remote nodes.
- configure --enable-ptrace-support now uses ptrace module (more modular code).
  The ptrace module should also be more robust.  It now fixes some additional
  cases that were missing earlier
- ./configure --enable-unique-checkpoint-filenames  was not respecting
  bin/dmtcp_checkpoint --checkpoint-open-files .  This is now fixed.
- If the coordinator received a kill request in the middle of a checkpoint, the
  coordinator could freeze or die.  This has now been fixed, with the expected
  behavior:  Kill the old computation that is in the middle of a checkpoint,
  and then allow any new computations to begin.
- dmtcp_inspector utility was broken in last release; now fixed
- configure --enable-forked-checkpoint was broken in the last release.  It is
  fixed again.
- Many smaller bug fixes.
- The debian packages and rpm packages for OpenSUSE will be submitted to the
  distros over the next few days.

Version 1.2.3 release notes
===========================

This release is primarily a bug-fix release. Here are the Release Notes:

- Several bug fixes.
- Modifications added for compatibility with the checkpoint-restart service of
  OpenMPI (will be integrated with upcoming OpenMPI-1.6)
- Tests for emacs, vim and strace added to 'make check'
- When running emacs23 under GNU 'screen', it's not restored correctly.
  Currently we warn user to use emacs22.  Emacs23 with 'screen' will be
  supported in future (and 'emacs23' continues to work fine standalone).
- Fixes a regression in which checkpointing 'gdb' with the required
  './configure --enable-ptrace-support' was failing.  Works now.
- /proc/*/cmdline was not being restored correctly when:  argc &gt; 1 (Fixed.)
- debugging logic (primarily for DMTCP developers) was simplified so that
  changing CFLAGS in mtcp/Makefile to add '-DDEBUG' suffices to include MTCP
  debugging information.  If --enable-debug is also configured, then a copy of
  MTCP debug information also goes into /tmp/dmtcp-USER@HOST/jassertlog.* .


Version 1.2.2 release notes
===========================

- A new module system, allowing users to write their own extensions to DMTCP,
  including wrappers around library calls.  See the module subdirectory for
  examples.
- ./configure --enable-m32 was not working in DMTCP 1.2.1.  It works again now.
- more bug fixes and robustness testing.  Tested on kernels ranging from Linux
  2.6.5 to the latest kernel.  Tested especially on the Linux distributions:
  Red Hat/Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, SuSe/OpenSUSE; although we don't know of any
  Linux distributions where it fails to run.
- 'screen' did not checkpoint properly on machines using LDAP authentication.
  This could also affect processes using 'bash'.  This has been fixed.
- Furthermore, recent versions of 'screen' began calling 'utempter' when
  present Support for 'utempter' and some other setuid processes has been
  added.
- Removed the requirement for libc.a in building DMTCP, since Red Hat does not
  include libc.a in its standard repository.
- ./configure --enable-ptrace now more robust.  Still labelled "experimental"
  for this release.  You will need to enable this if you want to checkpoint gdb
  sessions, programs running under strace, and certain other applications.
- ./configure --enable-fast-ckpt-restart  can make ckpt/restart faster by using
  'mmap'.  You will need to set the environment variable DMTCP_GZIP to "0" if
  you use this.  This feature is still experimental, and there are many other
  tricks for speeding up ckpt/restart.  Please talk to the developers if this
  is important for your application.
- Experimental support added for HBICT ( hbict.sf.net ).  This provides support
  for incremental and differential checkpointing.  However, this is still
  ongoing work.
- Work has begun on improved support for process migration between different
  Linux kernels and distributions.  Simple applications should migrate.  Please
  talk to us if this feature is important to you.
- We do not yet support the 'epoll' and 'inotify' Linux system calls.
  Recently, there has been some demand for this, and we intend to raise the
  priority.  Please talk to us if this feature is important to you.

Version 1.2.1 release notes
===========================

* Support for calling dmtcpaware API (dmtcpCheckpoint(), etc.) directly from
  inside a python session.
* The option for applications to use the dmtcpaware interface to link with a
  shared library (libdmtcpaware.so) instead of libdmtcpaware.a.
* Support for MPICH2 1.3.x (transparently checkpointing MPICH under DMTCP), as
  well as continuing the existing support for checkpointing OpenMPI.
* Support for running and checkpointing of binaries in non-privileged mode when
  the setuid/setgid bits of the binaries are set.
* Several bug fixes related to GNU screen.
* Experimental support for ptrace to allow checkpointing of gdb sessions,
  strace, and other ptrace-based applications.
* On restart, restore original process name for 'ps' and /proc/self/cmdline.
* Additional bug fixes and enhancements.

Version 1.2.0 release notes
===========================

* This is a semi-major release. DMTCP now supports GNU screen.
* It also fixes some instabilities in checkpointing Matlab under certain
  environments.
* Numerous bug fixes were implemented as a part of review of DMTCP sub-systems.

Version 1.1.9 release notes
===========================

* Better SIGNAL handling.
* Bug fixes for Session/Process group restoration.
* Bug fixes in file handling code.
* Other minor bug fixes and improvements.

Version 1.1.8 release notes
===========================

* DMTCP now works again with OpenMPI 1.4 and 1.5-pre (DMTCP releases 1.1.4
  through 1.1.7 were not working with OpenMPI).
* Other bug fixes and improvements

Version 1.1.7 release notes
===========================

* DMTCP now works with 32-bit Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid and glibc-2.11. It was broken
  in last release.
* Other bug fixes and improvements.

Version 1.1.6 release notes
===========================

* DMTCP now works with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid and glibc-2.11.
* Other bug fixes and improvements.

Version 1.1.5 release notes
===========================

* Bug fixes related to malloc family of functions.
* We strongly recommend that anyone with a malloc-intensive application, such
  as C++ with intensive use of STL, should upgrade.
* Some new flags for dmtcp_checkpoint, dmtcp_restart, dmtcp_command, and
  dmtcp_restart_script.sh. For more information run the command with --help.
* Simplified restart script for single process computations.
* Signal handling improved.
* Several other bug fixes and improvements.

Version 1.1.4 release notes
===========================

* Fix for a regression bug which affected checkpointing bash in previous
  release.
* DMTCP will support next release of Maplesoft.
* Improved support for Pid-Virtualization.
* Some users reported compilation error in previous release, fixed in this
  release.
* dmtcp_nocheckpoing command added.
* dmtcp_command supports multiple commands.
* Fix for not checkpointing dmtcp_* commands.
* Several other bug fixes and improvements.


Version 1.1.3 release notes
===========================

* Improved support for OpenMPI 1.3 and 1.4
* dmtcp_restart_script.sh allows user specified hostnames on restart.
* dmtcp_command now supports blocked checkpoint mode.
* Several other bug fixes and improvements.

Version 1.1.2 release notes
===========================

* Support for glibc 2.10.
* Thread safety mechanisms introduced for Pid-Virtualization Layer.
* Various other bug fixes related to Pid/Tid-Virtualization
