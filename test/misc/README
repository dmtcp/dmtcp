This directory is for utilities to help manually test some special cases.
Some of these special cases could be combined into autotest.py, and
  tested only on dmtcp1 by default, for the sake of speed.

Examples of special cases are:
* All CPU architectures:  x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64
* The three major branches of distros:  Debian/Ubuntu, and
                                          RedHat/Fedora/CoreOS, OpenSUSE/SUSE
* 32-bit Linux:  native, --enable-m32, and multi-arch  (see multi-arch.sh)
* 'make install' for native 64-bit and each of the 32-bit Linux combinations
* for file in test/plugin/*; do (cd $file && make check); done
* forked checkpointing
* fast restart
* --no-gzip
* --interval 5
* --no-coordinator
* --tmpdir
* --ckptdir
* --checkpoint-open-files (especially in the case of open, but deleted files)
* Coordinator specifications:
    '-p0 --port-file', --host, dmtcp_command,
    coordinator started in background versus coordinator in other window
* MPI:
  +  Implemenations: MVAPICH, Open MPI, Intel MPI
  +  Resource managers:  SLURM, Torque, ibrun
  *  Network:  InfiniBand (CM and UD), TCP
  +  Shared filesystems:  NFS, Lustre
* openmp and Intel TBB
* MIC
* SOON:  OpenGL
* Widely used commercial software:  Matlab, ...
* Non-default plugins:
  --ptrace, modify-env
  test/plugin/{applic-inititated-ckdpt,applic-delayed-ckpt}
* Builds of DMTCP with other compilers:  icc LLVM/Clang
