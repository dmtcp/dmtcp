In this example, 'dmtcp_launch -i 2' was invoked to checkpoint
every 2 seconds.  This plugin causes the application applic.c to delay
the checkpoint that is requested by the coordinator In this example,

The plugin is not needed here.  It's used only to generate printing of events.

Note the need to compile the target application with -fPIC , due to the use
of dmtcpDelayCheckpointsLock().  The '-fPIC' is needed so that the same binary
can used both with and without DMTCP.

This example is sufficient for most application, but more advanced
hooks to DMTCP are also listed in applic.c .
