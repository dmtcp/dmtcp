This plugin causes the application applic.c to invoke DMTCP
to checkpoint itself.

In this example, the target application applic.c contains:
  #include "dmtcp.h"
and also:
  dmtcp_checkpoint()

Note that the Makefile compiles applic.c into ./applic, and that this same
executable can be run with or without DMTCP:
  dmtcp_launch ./applic # dmtcp_checkpoint() invokes DMTCP to checkpoint
  ./applic  # dmtcp_checkpoint() returns the constant, DMTCP_NOT_PRESENT

The plugin libplugin-to-announce-events.so is not needed here.
It's used only to generate printing of events for the demonstration.

Note the need to compile the target application with -fPIC, due to the use
of dmtcp_checkpoint().  The '-fPIC' is needed so that the same binary
can be used both with and without DMTCP.


This example is sufficient for most applications, but more advanced
hooks to DMTCP are also listed in applic.c .
