This plugin causes the application applic.c to invoke DMTCP
to checkpoint itself.

The plugin is not needed here.  It's used only to generate printing of events.

Note the need to compile the target application with -fPIC, due to the use
of dmtcpCheckpoint().  The '-fPIC' is needed so that the same binary
can used both with and without DMTCP.


This example is sufficient for most application, but more advanced
hooks to DMTCP are also listed in applic.c .
