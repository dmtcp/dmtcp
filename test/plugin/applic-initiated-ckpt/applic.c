/* NOTE: This file must be compiled with -fPIC in order to work properly.
 *
 *       The code in this file will work both with and without DMTCP.
 *       Of course, the dmtcp.h file is needed in both cases.
 *
 * These functions are in <DMTCP_ROOT>/lib/dmtcp/libdmtcp.so and dmtcp.h
 *   int dmtcp_is_enabled() - returns 1 when running with DMTCP; 0 otherwise.
 *   int dmtcp_checkpoint() - returns DMTCP_AFTER_CHECKPOINT,
 *                                   DMTCP_AFTER_RESTART, or DMTCP_NOT_PRESENT.
 * These return 0 on success and DMTCP_NOT_PRESENT if DMTCP is not present.
 *   int dmtcp_disable_ckpt() - DMTCP will block any checkpoint requests.
 *   int dmtcp_enable_ckpt() - DMTCP will execute any blocked
 *               checkpoint requests, and will permit new checkpoint requests.
 *
 * FOR ADVANCED USERS, ONLY:
 *   dmtcp_get_local_status
 *   dmtcp_get_coordinator_status
 *   dmtcp_install_hooks
