		   Thread Creation and Thread Exit

This is intended as one of a series of informal documents to describe
and partially document some of the more subtle DMTCP data structures
and algorithms.  These documents are snapshots in time, and they
may become somewhat out-of-date over time (and hopefully also refreshed
to re-sync them with the code again).

[ WARNING:  Starting in DMTCP-2.2, this implementation was drastically
            modified.  Much of this information is obsolete.  See
            architecture-of-dmtcp.pdf for a less detailed but more
            up-to-date description. ]

This document is about thread creation and the exit of threads.  A closely
related document is pid-tid-virtualization.txt.  There are several subtleties
concerning thread creation and exit:
1) PID/TID virtualization:  If the process has restarted, then each thread
  process has an original tid and a current tid.  The TID virtualization
  of DMTCP translates between the original tid (which continues to be used
  by the user code), and the current tid (which is used by the kernel).
  For the most part, libc.so (and other run-time libraries) do not cache kernel
  thread ids, and so it suffices to assume that libc.so is using the
  current tid.  DMTCP wrappers are used to translate between the original tid
  and the current tid.
       Upon creation of a new thread, the new thread id will never conflict
  with the current tid of an existing thread.  But it _can_ correspond to the
  original tid of an existing thread.  This is called a _tid conflict_.
  In such cases, DMTCP will inspect the tid of a new thread and cause
  that thread to exit, and then create still another thread, if there is a
  tid conflict.
       This is done by DMTCP:clone_start, described below.  The mechanism
  for determining a thread conflict is that one field of the struct passed
  to DMTCP:clone_start is set to CLONE_UNINITIALIZED.  The new thread
  checks its own thread id (tid) and decides if there is a conflict.  It
  then sets that field to CLONE_FAIL (conflict) or CLONE_SUCCEED.  The
  creator of the thread has meanwhile also checked for a conflict, since
  clone() returns the tid to the creator.  In case of a conflict, the creator
  waits to see CLONE_FAIL in the given field, and then loops around
  to create a new thread.
2) MTCP keeps a thread descriptor of type Thread ('struct thread') for
  each running thread.  This is how MTCP maintains state information about
  that thread.  MTCP must create and delete these thread descriptors.
  This is done by MTCP:threadcloned (to create the descriptor) and
  DMTCP:pthread_start (to delete the thread descriptor).  DMTCP:pthread_start
  does this through a call to MTCP:threadiszombie().  (In the case that
  the user called clone() instead of pthread_create(), the thread
  will also return to MTCP:threadcloned(), which will call threadisdead().)
3) DMTCP keeps a thread virtual tid table.  When a thread exits, DMTCP
  can free up the space for that slot in the table.  Also, DMTCP can
  send an event notice using the DMTCP plugin system.

In order to clarify the logic, a timeline below describes the functions
called in the creation and exit of a thread.  The timeline assumes that
the application calls pthread_create(), but an obvious subset of this
timeline handles the case when the application directly calls clone().
To simplify the notation, pthread_create() and clone() show only the
thread start function that is called.  The timeline also shows what
other start functions will be called by that initial start function.

DMTCP:pthread_create(user_start_fn) ->
  glibc:pthread_create(DMTCP:pthread_start->user_start_fn) ->
    DMTCP:__clone(glibc:start_thread->DMTCP:pthread_start->user_start_fn) ->
      MTCP:clone(DMTCP:clone_start->glibc:start_thread->DMTCP:pthread_start->user_start_fn) ->
        glibc:clone(MTCP:threadcloned->DMTCP:clone_start->glibc:start_thread->DMTCP:pthread_start->user_start_fn) ->
          [ NEW THREAD BEGINNING ]
          MTCP:threadcloned ->
            DMTCP:clone_start -> [and retry if bad tid: exit to DMTCP:__clone and try again]
              glibc:start_thread ->
                DMTCP:pthread_start
                  user_start_fnc
                <- DMTCP:pthread_start [and change MTCP:Thread state to Zombie  -- and deletes from thread virt. pid table ]
              <- glibc:start_thread [will thread_exit here if thread is joined]

            <- MTCP:threadcloned [executes threadisdead to remove Thread descriptor]
          <- DMTCP:clone_start [ and deletes from virt. pid table ]
          [ NEW THREAD EXITS ]
        <- glibc:clone(...) NOT_REACHED [kernel killed thread]

glibc creates one wrapper around the start function.
DMTCP creates two wrappers around the start function.
MTCP creates one wrapper around the start function.

DMTCP:clone_start():
  This is an extra start_routine function set up by DMTCP:__clone().
  On entry, it checks if there is a TID conflict.  If there is a TID conflict,
    it returns, and forces DMTCP:__clone() to create a new thread.
  On exit, it calls threadiszombie??? and deletes items from pid virt.
    table (erase/eratsTid), and also issues thread_exit event for plugins

MTCP:threadcloned():
  This is an extra start_routine function set up by MTCP:__clone().
  On entry, it creates a Thread descriptor.
  On exit, it calls threadisdead() to delete Thread descriptor
    NOTE:  If clone() was called through pthread_create, glibc:start_thread may
	exit before reaching exit within this function.  So, threadisdead
	may not be called.  Hence, DMTCP:clone_start will set Thread to
	Zombie state on exit, in case this is never reached.
  
DMTCP:pthread_start():
  This is an extra start_routine function set up by DMTCP:pthread_create()
  On entry, it does nothing (besides pass on its arguments).
  On exit, it deletes items from virt. pid table (erase/eraseTid), and
	 also issues thread_exit event for plugins
  On exit, it sets the state in Thread descriptor to Zombie.
    NOTE:  If MTCP:threadcloned() is called later, we must guard
      against deleting the thread twice.  This is why we just
      change the state of the Thread descriptor to Zombie.
      Either threadisdead() will delete the Thread descriptor, or it will
      be done at checkpoint time.

NOTE:
 * A small amount of additional logic is needed in case the user called
    clone() directly instead of pthread_create().  This involves using:
    static __thread isInPthread = false;
    Then, MTCP or DMTCP can do the right thing inside the __clone wrapper.
 * Arguably, one could say that glibc:start_thread failed to follow the first
    law of wrappers:  return instead of exit in case there is a wrapper around
    this function.  Of course, there was no reason for glibc to believe
    that other code would interact with this glibc-internal wrapper.
 * We need a wrapper around pthread_exit() for the same reason:  in case
    a thread exits early instead of returning through our MTCP:threadcloned()
    wrapper. : should do threadiszombie()

NOTE TO MYSELF TO FIX IN FINAL VERSION:
 * Remove MTCP:pthread_join  (not needed now)
 * Remove DMTCP:dmtcp_reset_gettid in one place, where threadiszombie
	 should be enough
