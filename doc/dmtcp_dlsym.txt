		A Better dlsym() :  Returning the Default Version

This is intended as one of a series of informal documents to describe
and partially document some of the more subtle DMTCP data structures
and algorithms.  These documents are snapshots in time, and they
may become somewhat out-of-date over time (and hopefully also refreshed
to re-sync them with the code again).

The GNU extension of the POSIX system call, dlsym(), was designed
to support the concept of wrapper functions around a library,
by using the pseudo-handle, RTLD_NEXT.  See 'man 3 dlopen' for details.
In summary, something like the following example should work:
  int fnc() {
    void *handle = dlopen(RTLD_NEXT, RTLD_LAZY);
    void *fnc_real = dlsym(handle, "fnc");
    int (*fnc_ptr)() = fnc_real;
    return (*fnc_ptr)();
  }

This does work, except in some situations where symbol versioning
is used.  Symbol versioning is also a GNU extension.  It includes
a concept of the "default version", and libraries that don't specify
a particular version will invoke the default version.  Unfortunately,
in the code above, dlsym will usually return the oldest version instead
of the default version.  This behavior is not documented in 'man dlsym',
but it is easily seen in tests.

DMTCP has implemented DLSYM_DEFAULT(), a replacement for dlsym(),
which will return the _default version_, which is presumably the
desired behavior for most users calling this.

These notes will help to understand the concepts and background for
the implementations of src/dmtcp_dlsym.cpp.

EXPLANATION:
The "default version" doesn't seem to be a concept explicitly defined
in the standard.  But in practice, references to the "default version"
refer to the _unique_ symbol version, which is not a hidden symbol.
So, we stop to define "hidden symbol".

A hidden symbol is a symbol in the lookup table for which the "hidden
bit" is set.  The intention was that only one symbol version (the
default version) should be visible to linkers that don't know about
symbol versioning.  All other versions should be hidden.

So, a software package links to the "default version", unless it
explicitly asks for a specific hidden version.  The function dlsym()
unfortunately usually links to the oldest version, instead of the

It depends on each
software package to define at most one non-hidden symbol.
 newest version
(the one on which no other version depends; and the versioning standard
defines dependencies among version numbers).
default version.  GNU provides the alternative function, dlvsym,
which will link to a specific version of a symbol.  But then to link
to the default version, a programmer must first know the name (or
version number) of the default version.  There is no GNU extension
to automatically discover the default version number.  Further,
different Linux distros may be using different default versions.
So, the default version number is not a universally fixed value.

====
BACKGROUND DETAILS OF THE ELF LINKER:

The rest of this note explains how the macro DLSYM_DEFAULT()
(and the function dlsym_default_internal()) find the default symbol.
This is done in src/dmtcp_dlsym.cpp.

The versym ELF section defines the symbol version strings of that file (and it
states if a symbol version depends on a different one).  The versym ELF
section is an extension of the dynsym (Dynamic Symbol) section.  It is
the same length as the dynsym version.  The dynsym section is an array
of structs and the versym section is an array of "version indexes".
Thus it acts as an extra field in the dynsym section.  (This way,
versioning can stay hidden from linkers that don't know about versioning.)

The dynsym section is itself a subset of the symbol section, including only
those symbols needed for dynamic linking.  That's why "nm -D" may
show symbols when "nm -S" fails (when the object was stripped).
A stripped object must keep its dynamic symbols or it can never be
used for dynamic linking.

If the high order bit (bit number 15) of the version symbol is set, the
object cannot be used and the static linker shall ignore the symbol's
presence in the object.  This bit is sometimes known as a "hidden bit",
because an outside object can link to it only if it explicitly requests
the specific version string.  Hence, if there is only one version
of a symbol without a hidden bit, then that version is the default version
for that symbol.

If an unversioned symbol reference is linked with an object that has
versioned symbols, then it is only allowed to link with the version
index 1 (aka "GLOBAL", used for unversioned symbols) or version index
2 (typically defined within an object file as the oldest version string of
that file).  These two versions are known as the base definition.  (An
unversioned symbol will have index 1 for its base definition, while
a versioned symbol will have index 2 for its base definition.)
The above are the rules for the "static linker" (linking done at load-time).

In calls to dlopen, the "dynamic linker" is called.  If the dynamic linker
does not find a base definition for a symbol, and if only one version
is defined, it can link to that version.  (I'm not sure if that's allowed
then the one defined version has the hidden bit set in the versym entry.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Strings can be compared using strcmp.  But one can also use the
hash ELF section for symbol names.  This entry specifies the hash function
to use:

The following are very rough notes taken in writing the implementation.
No promises about readability:

The base definition is for the filename (VER_FLG_BASE in vd_flags)!

Should read the version definition (DT_VERDEF) section.
That has a series of ElfXX_Verdef structs
Each one has a vd_cnt of the number of versions in the vd_aux,
  and a vd_aux entry with
    vda_name:
      The string table offset to a null-terminated string, giving the name of the version definition
    and vda_next for the offset to a dependency of this versioned symbol
	(for dependencies of this version definition:  each dependency
	 will have its own version definition)
    The first vda definition is the version name for this entry (each verdef
	entry may be for a different version of same symbol)
  and a vd_next pointing to the next ElfXX_Verdef entry
  and a vd_ndx index that uniquely associates it with a versym entry of the
	same index.  (This just a unique index which matches the _value_
	in the versym array.  It is not an array index.  The versym array
	is meant to add an extra field into the symtab section (array of
	structs).  The field is a unique index corresponding to vd_ndx for
	some version def.  Since the versym section and symtab section are
	the same length, you can also use the same array index for both.)

The versym section has a number of symbols the same as in the symbols section.
  It's an array of ElfXX_Versym half-words.  If it's VER_NDX_GLOBAL (= 1),
  then it's the base definition (default version); Otherwise, it's a
  user-defined version definition (for constant greater than 1)
  (Could it be that number 2 is for default version and number 1 for base?)
  Maybe user must specify higher integer for each extra version, so that
  this acts as a kind of numeric index for the version name??
  And version references start where version definitions leave off.

This link was also useful for documenting the ELF symbol table.

The SYMTAB section has a st_name which is an index into the symbol string table.
