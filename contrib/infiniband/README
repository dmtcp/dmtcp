This plugin supports checkpointing of applications over InfiniBand.
(By default, DMTCP provides checkpoint-restart for TCP (socket-based networks.)

Currently this plugin supports the standard OFED verbs API for InfiniBand,
but vendor-specific InfiniBand APIs are not supported.

This is the work of Jiajun Cao et al.  Please report bugs to
dmtcp@ccs.neu.edu as well as to jiajun using his account at ccs.neu.edu.

 * Note that this plugin will be reorganized by the end of January, 2014.
 * The reorganized plugin will not be available in time for the DMTCP 2.1
 * release.  If you are using DMTCP 2.1, consider getting the newer plugin from
 * the DMTCP svn.

To use InfiniBand, you must have first configured DMTCP to use it:
To do so:
  cd <DMTCP_ROOT>  # replace with wherever your DMTCP_ROOT is.
  ./configure --enable-infiniband-support
  make clean
  make
  bin/dmtcp_launch --ib ./a.out

EXPERTS ONLY: libibtrace.so can also be built

Note, configuring with '--enable-infiniband-support' will still allow
DMTCP to be used with standard TCP instead of InfiniBand.

However, this option is currently incompatible with a DMTCP optimization.
DMTCP normally creates zero-fill-on-demand pages when it finds a
page of all zeroes.  The '--enable-infiniband-support' disallows this
optimization.  Zero pages will be saved as full pages of zeroes in the
checkpoint image.  This is a bug that will be fixed in a future release.
