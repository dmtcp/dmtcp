instructions on installing and debugging.

## Instructions for building:

 0. Get DMTCP and checkout the v3 branch

    $ git clone git@github.com:rohgarg/dmtcp-mpi-proxy.git
    $ cd dmtcp-mpi-proxy
    $ git checkout mpi-proxy-plugin-v3

 1. Configure DMTCP with:

     $ ./configure --enable-debug CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11'

 2. Build DMTCP with

     $ make
     $ ./compile-coord-cori.sh

    (Usually, just running 'make' would suffice, but for Cori, I have
     to compile the coordinator differently. The normal compilation
     step doesn't work. At some point, I'll integrate this step into the
     normal build process, and then, this additional script wouldn't be
     required.)

 3. Build the MPI plugin.

     $ cd contrib/mpi-proxy-split
     $ make install

    This also creates an MPI stub library. Instead of the real MPI
    library, we link the target program with this. For example,

      $ cc -c mpi-test.c -o mpi-test.o
      $ cc mpi-test.o -o mpi-test.exe -lmpidummy

      $ make tests

    This will create some test programs with the MPI stub library.

 4. I have a version of GROMACS (mdrun_mpi) linked with the MPI stub
    library at:

       ~rohgarg/local/bin/mdrun_mpi.dummy

## Instructions for running:

I typically run interactively.

 1. Allocate node(s).

      $ salloc -N 2 -C haswell -q interactive -t 00:10:00

 2. In one terminal, start the DMTCP coordinator process.

      $ cd $DMTCP_ROOT
      $ bin/dmtcp_coordinator --mpi

      (I have added this special `--mpi` flag. This adds support
       in the coordinator for checkpointing using the MPI plugin.
       This flag is not available in regular DMTCP.)

 3. In another terminal, launch the program.

      $ cd $DMTCP_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/
      $ export LD_LIBRAY_PATH=$LD_LIBRAY_PATH:`pwd`
      $ srun -n 2 $DMTCP_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_launch --no-gzip -j -h <coord-host> --disable-dl-plugin --with-plugin ./libdmtcp_mpi-proxy-split.so  ./test/ping_pong.dummy.exe

    (Right now, the program has an additional fixed 2 second startup
     time. I'll fix this in the next iteration.)

 4. Invoke a checkpoint by entering 'c' in the coordinator window.

    (You can also list the currently running ranks by entering 'l'
     command.)

    This will create checkpoint image files in the current directory.
    Checkpoint image for each rank is placed in a different directory
    (ckpt_rank_N/ckpt_*.dmtcp).

 5. Kill the running ranks.

 6. Restart by listing the checkpoint images in order.

    $ srun -n 2 $DMTCP_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_restart -j -h <coord-host> --mpi ckpt_rank_0/ckpt_*.dmtcp ckpt_rank_1/ckpt_*.dmtcp ...

    (Again, this `--mpi` is a special option I have added to the
     restart command. This enables MPI-specific features in the restart
     code.)
