General notes for building, testing and running on Cori supercomputer:

The main pointers for background information on MANA are:

MANA at github:
  https://github.com/mpickpt/mana/tree/refactoring
  (This is the refactoring branch of https://github.com/mpickpt/mana;
   soon, this should be merged into the 'master' branch.)
and MANA documentation:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pT25gvMNeT1Vz4SU6Gp4Hx9MGLfkK8ZK-sSOwtu5R50/edit

Building MANA:
  cd MANA_ROOT_DIR && ./configure --enable-debug && make -j mana

The main scripts for this:
  mana_coordinator, mana_launch, mana_restart, mana_status
See MANA_ROOT_DIR/manpages/mana.1 for the MANA man page.

At this time, the steps to build MANA (on Cori) are roughly as follows.

  module unload craype-hugepages2M
  # Modify the salloc command according to your needs:
  salloc -N 1 -C haswell -q interactive -t 03:00:00
  git clone https://github.com/mpickpt/mana
  git checkout refactoring  # current development branch; later to be 'master'
  cd mana
  # Development branch.  (Eventually, the 'master' branch will be preferred.)
  git checkout refactoring
  ./configure
  make -j  # Build in source directory: create bin, lib directories.
  pushd contrib/mpi-proxy-split  # Go to plugin directory.
  (cd test && make -j)
  make install
  pushd  # Go back to the MANA root directory
  make -j  # Make it again. The plugin 'make' added an extra file to core DMTCP.
  pushd  # Go back to plugin directory: mpi-proxy-split
  cd test # We're now in:  contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test

To test MANA, see the MANA man page.  A short version is:
  export MANA_ROOT=$HOME/mana  # Adjust for your directory.
  cd $MANA_ROOT/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/test
  make tidy # Remove old ckpt files from a previous session.
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/mana_coordinator
  # This does interval checkpointing every 5 seconds.
  make mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/mana_launch -i5 ./mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
  # [ creates ckpt:   ls ckpt_rank_*/ckpt_*.dmtcp ]
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/mana_coordinator
  srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/mana_restart

To see if a coordinator (or other process) is already running do:
  ps uxw
For the status of the various MANA ranks/processes, do:
  $MANA_ROOT/bin/mana_status -l

================================================================================
Debugging internals of MANA:

For either command line with srun (or mpirun), prefix the command line
with 'DMTCP_MANA_PAUSE=1' and run the command in the background:
  DMTCP_MANA_PAUSE=1 srun/mpirun ... &
It will stop with a printout about how to attach in GDB.  Execute that command.
Then:  (gdb) p dummy=0

If you're debugging dmtcp_launch:
  DMTCP_MANA_PAUSE=1 srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_launch ...
then it will drop you inside dmtcp_launch.  To reach, for example,
mpi-proxy-split/split-process.c:splitProcess(), then do:
  (gdb) b execvp
  (gdb) continue
  (gdb) b splitProcess
  (gdb) continue
This is in a global constructor that executes before main.  To reach 'main'
of the target executable, do 'b main' instead.

Similarly for dmtcp_restart, DMTCP_MANA_PAUSE=1 drops you in
  src/mtcp/mtcp_restart.c shortly before mtcp_restart.c:splitProcess().
If you want to reach the target executable, use DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE=1 instead.

When debugging in GDB, you can switch back and forth between upper half and
lower half programs as follows (assuming you're in .../mpi-proxy-split/test).
This is useful for examining both the upper and lower half stacks.
  (gdb) file ../../../lh_proxy
  (gdb) file ../mpi_hello_world.mana.exe
If you had previously set a breakpoint before switching, then use:
  (gdb) set breakpoint always-inserted on
before switching among lower and upper halves.

When debugging with GDB after restart, if you are debugging inside the
target application, then a good strategy is:
  DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE=1 srun -n 1 $MANA_ROOT/bin/dmtcp_restart ...
It will pause, with instructions:
  (gdb) p dummy=0
  (gdb) source DMTCP_ROOT/util/gdb-add-symbol-files-all
  (gdb) add-symbol-files-all
The script gdb-add-symbol-files-all is a workaround that became necessary
since Linux 3.10, when Linux created a backwards-incompatible change
after which GDB has been failing to find the symbols for debugging.

================================================================================
Building and testing on ordinary CentOS/Ubuntu (not the Cori supercomputer):

Before going into details, there are a few prerequisites:
A.  We have only tested with MPICH, not Open MPI.  Open MPI doesn't
    seem to support a statically linked MPI library.  (MANA uses a
    static MPI library in its lower half, while the MPI application continues
    to be linked dynamically  MANA's lower-half static MPI library can
    be replaced by a standard dynamic MPI library, but this would requires
    further work, and is not a current priority.)
B.  The MPICH package supplied with CentOS 7 provides mpicc, which
    accepts a '-static' flag.  But this is not sufficient for
    actual use.  To configure MANA to work with MPICH and '-static', see:
      MANA_ROOT_DIR/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/lower-half/README.mpich-static
C.  Note MANA_ROOT_DIR/contrib/mpi-proxy-split/Makefile_configure.in
    for additional customization (for example, not Cori, not MPICH).
D.  OPTIONAL: Probably the 'configure' above suffices.  But if 'mpicc -show'
    indicates a flag '-lxml2' anyway, then this will create a dependency on
    libxml2.a.  Even if you have installed the package 'libxml2', then you
    _must_ also install 'libxml2-dev' (libxml2-devel in CentOS) to get
    'libxml2.a'.
    (If you are missing libxml2.a and lack root privilege, try copying libxml2.a
     from some distro package, as described in README.mpich-static.)

Building outside of Cori for MPICH:
If you have satisfied the prerequisites above, then do 'make -j mana'
and continue as for Cori.

===
Testing and running is mostly the same as described at the top.
However, if not running on a traditional HPC cluster,
your site, you may need to replace 'srun' with 'mpirun'
in the two commands for dmtcp_launch and dmtcp_restart, above.

In a further complication, if using 'mpirun' with MPICH-derived MPI
implementations, you may need to replace 'srun' with:
  mpirun -iface ETHERNET_INTERFACE
You should find the correct definition of MPIRUN in:
  contrib/mpi-proxy-split/Makefile_config

MANA tries to guess the required Ethernet interface in 'configure-mana'.
Hopefully, that guess will be correct.  But see below for the issues, and
under what circumstances MANA might guess the wrong interface and fail
for an MPICH-derived MPI on a non-HPC cluster.
[ This issue may now be solved now, using gethostbyname-static.tar.gz.
  The issue used to arise because the lower half, lh_proxy, was compiled
  statically with libc.a.  However, libc.a does not directly support
  gethostbyname and getaddrinfo.  Instead, it tries to load libnss_*.so.
  But we wanted lh_proxy to be statically linked so that it would consist
  only of text/data/stack, and later calls to mmap. ]

NOTE: On HPC clusters, it is more common to use 'srun', along with a custom
      network interface (InfiniBand, Cray GNI, etc.).  So, most likely
      Ethernet will not be used, and libc.a will not call libnss_*.so.

The file MANA_ROOT/configure-mana tries to guess the Ethernet interface with:
  ip addr | grep -B1 link/ether  # and choose one of those interfaces
OR ELSE:
  ifconfig -a (deprecated)
If necessary, change the definition of MPIRUN in configure-mana for the
correct Ethernet interface on your compute node.  [ But this may no
longer be necessary. ]
