- When environ is not yet initialized, currently dmtcphijack.so simply returns.
  (This occurs when executing libc.so.6 .)
  We should spend more effort to find environ at top of stack.
  Note that bash also plays tricks with environ, but bash still gives
    us a working getenv().

- We currently wrap fork(), but not vfork().  Usually, the exec happens
  soon after vfork().  But if we checkpoint after vfork() and before
  exec, then we would miss the child process.  This should be fixed.

- setsighandler fails if user has reset our signal handler
  Do we cleanly tell the user what signal is being used by app,
  and to reurn dmtcp with --sigckpt  set to other signal?

- Extend list of syscalls using netdb to put wrappers around them.
  The danger is that in invoking the netdb, they might want to
  create a socket.  Then we detect this, and we try to create
  a socket to the coordinator.  This hits our wrapper function, which
  then creates an infinite loop.  At least, we think we saw this in
  Ubuntu 6.06 (dapper).
          
- Many more exotic fcntl()/ioctl() flags are not checkpointed

- Fifos are not handled correctly, do any apps use them?
  Yes, screen (Artem)
