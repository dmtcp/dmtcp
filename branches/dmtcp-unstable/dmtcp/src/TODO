PID-VIRTUALIZATION:
-1 dmtcp_restart.cpp:
     read tidVector for each process and insert the tids into pidMapTable
       because we don't want any conflict between pids and tids.
0. wait status of zombie processes
     Store status of those processes which were zombie at checkpoint time. If
     the parent process does a wait() system call for that child after restart
     we should return its status.
1. restore process group leader, session leader, terminal owner etc.
2. update dmtcp_restart.cpp to check and restore orphaned child processes at restart.
3. add TID-Virtualization support at DMTCP layer.
4. better error handling for missing processes.
5. Tab completion fails on tcsh.

GENERAL:
1. Should refuse to call DMTCP recursively, perhaps by maintaining
  environment variable $DMTCPLVL (similar to $SHLVL), and refusing
  to recurse if it's already 1.  (Maybe in the future, we might
  support this.)
2. dmtcp_coordinator should refuse to allow other users to connect to it.
  (Are there security issues with respect to spoofing, also?)
