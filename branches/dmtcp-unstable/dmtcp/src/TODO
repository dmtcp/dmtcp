PID-VIRTUALIZATION:
1. restore process group leader, session leader, terminal owner etc.
2. update dmtcp_restart.cpp to check and restore orphaned child processes at restart.
3. add TID-Virtualization support at DMTCP layer.
4. better error handling for missing processes.
5. Tab completion fails on tcsh.

GENERAL:
1. Should refuse to call DMTCP recursively, perhaps by maintaining
  environment variable $DMTCPLVL (similar to $SHLVL), and refusing
  to recurse if it's already 1.  (Maybe in the future, we might
  support this.)
2. dmtcp_coordinator should refuse to allow other users to connect to it.
  (Are there security issues with respect to spoofing, also?)
