/*
 * _wrapperExecutionLock is used to make the checkpoint safe by making sure
 *   that no user-thread is executing any DMTCP wrapper code when it receives
 *   the checkpoint signal.
 * Working:
 *   On entering the wrapper in DMTCP, the user-thread acquires the read lock,
 *     and releases it before leaving the wrapper.
 *   When the Checkpoint-thread wants to send the SUSPEND signal to user
 *     threads, it must acquire the write lock. It is blocked until all the
 *     existing read-locks by user threads have been released. NOTE that this
 *     is a WRITER-PREFERRED lock.
 *
 * There is a corner case too -- the newly created thread that has not been
 *   initialized yet; we need to take some extra efforts for that.
 * Here are the steps to handle the newly created uninitialized thread:
 *   A counter (_uninitializedThreadCount) for the number of newly
 *     created uninitialized threads is kept.  The counter is made
 *     thread-safe by using a mutex.
 *   The calling thread (parent) increments the counter before calling clone.
 *   The newly created child thread decrements the counter at the end of
 *     initialization in MTCP/DMTCP.
 *   After acquiring the Write lock, the checkpoint thread waits until the
 *     number of uninitialized threads is zero. At that point, no thread is
 *     executing in the clone wrapper and it is safe to do a checkpoint.
 *
 * XXX: Currently this security is provided only for the clone wrapper; this
 * should be extended to other calls as well.           -- KAPIL

/*
 * Execute fork() and exec() wrappers in exclusive mode
 *
 * fork() and exec() wrappers pass on the state/information about the current
 * process/program to the to-be-created process/program.
 *
 * There can be a potential race in the wrappers if this information gets
 * changed between the point where it was acquired and the point where the
 * process/program is created. An example of this situation would be a
 * different thread executing an open() call in parallel creating a
 * file-descriptor, which is not a part of the information/state gathered
 * earlier. This can result in unexpected behavior and can cause the
 * program/process to fail.
 *
 * This patch fixes this by acquiring the Wrapper-protection-lock in exclusive
 * mode (write-lock) when executing these wrappers. This guarantees that no
 * other thread would be executing inside a wrapper that can change the process
 * state/information.
 *
 * NOTE:
 * 1. Currently, we do not have WRAPPER_EXECUTION_LOCK/UNLOCK for socket()
 *    family of wrapper. That would be fixed in a later commit.
 * 2. We need to come up with a strategy for certain blocking system calls
 *    that can change the state of the process (e.g. accept).
 * 3. Using trywrlock() can result in starvation if multiple other threads are
 *    rapidly acquiring releasing the lock. For example thread A acquires the
 *    rdlock for 100 ms. Thread B executes and trywrlock and fails. Thread B
 *    sleeps goes to sleep for some time. While thread B is sleeping, thread A
 *    releases the rdlock and reacquires it or some other thread acquires the
 *    rdlock. This would cause the thread B to starve. This scenario can be
 *    easily observed if thread A calls
 *      epoll_wait(fd, events, max_events, -1).
 *    It is wrapped by the epoll_wait wrapper in IPC plugin, which then makes
 *    repeated calls to _real_epoll_wait with smaller timeout.
