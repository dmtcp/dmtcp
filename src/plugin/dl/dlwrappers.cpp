/* Reason for using thread_performing_dlopen_dlsym:
 *
 * dlsym/dlopen/dlclose make a call to calloc() internally. We do not want to
 * checkpoint while we are in the midst of dlopen etc. as it can lead to
 * undesired behavior. To do so, we use WRAPPER_EXECUTION_DISABLE_CKPT() at the
 * beginning of the funtion. However, if a checkpoint request is received right
 * after WRAPPER_EXECUTION_DISABLE_CKPT(), the ckpt-thread is queued for wrlock
 * on the pthread-rwlock and any subsequent request for rdlock by other threads
 * will have to wait until the ckpt-thread releases the lock. However, in this
 * scenario, dlopen calls calloc, which then calls
 * WRAPPER_EXECUTION_DISABLE_CKPT() and hence resulting in a deadlock.
 *
 * We set this variable to true, once we are inside the dlopen/dlsym/dlerror
 * wrapper, so that the calling thread won't try to acquire the lock later on.
 *
 * EDIT: Instead of acquiring wrapperExecutionLock, we acquire libdlLock.
 * libdlLock is a higher priority lock than wrapperExectionLock i.e. during
 * checkpointing this lock is acquired before wrapperExecutionLock by the
 * ckpt-thread.
 * Rationale behind not using wrapperExecutionLock and creating an extra lock:
 *   When loading a shared library, dlopen will initialize the static objects
 *   in the shared library by calling their corresponding constructors.
 *   Further, the constructor might call fork/exec to create new
 *   process/program. Finally, fork/exec require the wrapperExecutionLock in
 *   exclusive mode (writer lock). However, if dlopen wrapper acquires the
 *   wrapperExecutionLock, the fork wrapper will deadlock when trying to get
 *   writer lock.
 *
 * EDIT: The dlopen() wrappers causes the problems with the semantics of RPATH
 * associated with the caller library. In future, we can work without this
 * plugin by detecting if we are in the middle of a dlopen by looking up the
 * stack frames.
