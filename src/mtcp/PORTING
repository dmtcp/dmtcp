 			PORTING TO A NEW CPU

FIXME:  This was valid with respect to DMTCP-2.1.  It must be updated
        for DMTCP-2.2 and beyond.
        See <DMTCP_ROOT>/doc/architecture-of-dmtcp.pdf for a more up-to-date
        description of the DMTCP architecture, albeit less detailed.


One of the trickier parts of updating MTCP is tls_get_thread_area,
since it seems like it is implemented differently on each architecture.
A problem is that pthread_t is defined only as 'unsigned long' for
users, when inside glibc it is really 'struct pthread *'.  To find
it and its size, the easiest way is:
gdb test/pthread1
(gdb) b pthread_create
(gdb) r
(gdb) step
(gdb) p sizeof(struct pthread)
(gdb) ptype struct pthread
(gdb) dir GLIBC_ROOT_DIR/nptl
(gdb) where

[ This considers only porting to a new CPU in Linux, and not to porting to a
  new operating system.  That would require a discussion of other issues. ]

Porting DMTCP to a new CPU is largely an issue of porting MTCP.
In most cases, one can search on __arm__ to find the CPU-specific
portions of code.  These are few (less than 20 lines of inline assembly).
However, this provides a checklist of conceptual issues to consider
in porting. 

In addition, there were two issues particular to ARM.  First, ARM is not
one of the central architectures for glibc, and so it is found
in glibc-ports instead of glibc.  Second, Linux for ARM has more than 
one API.  The API for a direct kernel system call changed between
the older ARM API and the newer ARM-EABI API.  Thus, glibc has
files specific to the ARM CPU (for any API), and files specific
to the ARM CPU using the EABI API.

ISSUES considered in the port to ARM:

1.  Use of ELF linker - no changes needed for ARM
2.  Use of POSIX API - In earlier years, getcontext/setcontext was
        preferred over sigsetjump/siglongjmp.  Currently,
        getcontext/setcontext is depracated, and not provided in
        ARM for glibc-ports-2.14.
3.  ARM EABI inline kernel system call - an example occurs in mtcp_futex.h.
4.  Linux kernel system calls usually return an int on 32-bit systems.
        That int, rc, has a value of  0 > rc > -4096  when an error
        is returned, and "- rc" is the errno.  The comparison with -4096
        can be important, and testing "rc < 0" is often not sufficient.
        Some system calls may return a large unsigned int (e.g. pointer
        to high memory) which appears to be negative when viewed simply
        as an int.
5.  MTCP needs to make direct kernel system calls.  Rather than reinvent the
        appropriate macros, it uses macros from sysdep.h in glibc.
        In the case of ARM, these come from glibc at:
          glibc-ports-2.14/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/arm/sysdep.h
          glibc-ports-2.14/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/arm/eabi/sysdep.h
6.  When MTCP restarts, it asks the kernel for a new thread.  The kernel
        may assign a new stack location and a new TLS (thread-local storage).
        The kernel and glibc cooperate on Each CPU to maintain
        a register that points to the TLS (%fs on x86, %gs on x86_64,
        register c13 of co-processor p15 on ARM).  Specifically, the
        register points to a TCB (thread control block) for the TLS.
            On ARM, the host CPU can read p15/c13 using "mrc", but writing
        to them ("mcr") is a privileged kernel-mode instruction on ARM.
        Linux on ARM provides an additional kernel systems call with call
        number:  __ARM_NR_set_tls .  This is used instead of "mcr".
7.  On Linux ARM, the thread-local pointer register points to the byte after
        the end of a TCB (thread control block, datatype: struct pthread)
        instead of to the beginning of the TCB.  MTCP needs to find an offset
        into the TCB where the pid and tid are stored, and then update those
        to the current pid and tid on restart.  In the case of ARM, it must
        first subtract "sizeof(struct pthread)" from the thread pointer
        register, before adding the offset used to find the location
        where pid/tid are stored.
