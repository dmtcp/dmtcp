Documentation by Gene Cooperman -- no guarantees of accuracy

glibc_kernel_stat.h, sysdep-i386.h, and sysdep-x86_64.h are all taken
from glibc.  Glibc has a LGPL license.  The rest of the MTCP software
has a still stricter license:  GPL

=========================================================================
CAVEATS:
    This is designed only for Intel/AMD Linux: either 32- or 64-bits.  With
some work, this design should be portable to many other UNIX dialects.
    Restart will use original application executable from disk.  If it has
changed since then, the result is unpredictable.
    MTCP will correctly continue reading/writing any open files, but if
those files have changed in the interim, the result is unpredictable.
    If it was being run under gdb prior to checkpointing, then gdb created
an extra pipe and connected stdout to the pipe.  Since gdb no longer exists
upon restart, restart fails.  This may be fixed in the future.  For now,
processes under gdb control cannot be checkpointed.

    On 32-bit Intel, there is no executable bit for memory pages.
This makes buffer overrun exploits possible by executing code on the stack
or in the data segment.  Several Linux distributions employ randomizing
techniques to make such exploits difficult.  Randomizing standard memory
locations also makes checkpoint/restart difficult.  DMTCP automatically
works around some of those cases, and requires user cooperation in some
other cases.  Some examples follow:
    Ubuntu configures gcc to use -fstack-protector (at least in 32-bit Ubuntu).
DMTCP accounts for that.  But a checkpointed file on a non-Ubuntu system may
not restart correctly on an Ubuntu system.  If this is a concern, then compile
all of your applications with -fno-stack-protector for portability between
Ubuntu and other dialects of Linux.
    Many recent 32-bit versions of Linux now set /proc/sys/vm/vdso_enabled
to 1.  This randomly changes the way system calls are made.  When DMTCP detects
that this is the case, it will stop and print to the screen asking to set:
  echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/vdso_enabled   [as root].
    Glibc employs an acceleration mechanism, NSCD (Name Service Cache
Daemon).  The daemon looks up names and caches them so that processes
can obtain the information faster.  This is especially useful on servers.
NSCD is employed both on 32-bit and on 64-bit computers.
On SUSE clients, NSCD is enabled with "shared files".  The application
mmaps a file that is shared with the daemon.  On restart, this shared
mmap-ed file no longer exists on disk.  DMTCP checks this and warns
that checkpointing may fail.  One can re-configure NSCD to not use
shared files.  In the future, DMTCP may implement a planned workaround.
=========================================================================
The object file mtcp_restart_nolibc.o cannot refer to any symbols from glibc
(see below),
since it will execute at a time when glibc no longer exists in memory.
Previously, this was accomplished by having extractobjectmodule extract
from libc.a any needed modules and statically linking them.

On x86_64 architectures, we're not able to unmap the stack.  But we
still have read-write permission.  So, instead of failing when we
try to mmap the saved stack on restart, we simply use the existing
stack segment, and copy the saved stack into RAM.

This version does not use extractobjectmodule.  Instead, it uses
  mtcp_sys.h, which defines inline syscalls for all needed kernel services.
  It also refers to mtcp_sys_errno for setting errno after such a syscall,
  since errno is normally defined in libc.so.

On x86_64 (and on i386 programs using thread-local variables),
  position-independent code must be used ("CFLAGS += -fPIC -DPIC"
  and "LDFLAGS = -shared").
  However, if a symbol is external, the GNU C compiler cannot call the
  function as a simple program-counter relative address.  This is because
  the ELF standard allows one to define an "interposing symbol" so
  that if one had previously linked a function external to a library,
  and if one then links in the library (libmtcp.so in our case), then
  even if the library also defines a function symbol of the same name,
  the library call will be bound to the previous (external function)
  that was linked in.  So, the GNU C compiler apparently is calling
  additional code from a different segment to handle this case.  When we
  call from mtcp_restart_nolibc.c, we don't have a different segment.  So, any
  functions called by mtcp_restart_nolibc.c must not be global symbols.
  One can either concatenate all files into one long one and declare
  all symbols static (yuck!), or else declare such global symbols
  to be library scope only (ELF hidden symbols).  See mtcp_internal.h
  for declarations:  __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))
  [ I was lazy and only declared the functions that caused the code to break.
    Why don't I need to do it for functions like mtcp_readhex? ]

The __i386__ does not use futex, but the __x86_64__ version does, since
the alternative is to use the pthread library, and __x86_64__ seems
to have problems with this library not being fully loaded.  WHY??

RESTART: Overview

[ READ FROM TOP TO BOTTOM:  new column represents alternative memory map ]
mtcp_restart
[load checkpointed libmtcp.so from .mtcp image]
  libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):restore_start
  [switch to temporary stack inside libmtcp.so]
                      libmtcp.so(mtcp_restart_nolibc.c):restoreverything :
		      [unmap everything except libmtcp.so (& maybe except vdso)
		       and remap remaining sections from .mtcp image]
  libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):finishrestore
  [reset stack ptr to old pre-checkpoint stack,
   reset kernel state appropriately]
  restarthread(motherofall)
  [Current thread becomes motherofall, the original user thread;
   Then restart remaining user threads and the ckpt thread;
   each thread calls siglongjmp/setcontext to get back to its
   original pre-checkpoint call frame]

1.  Run:  mtcp_restart FILE.mtcp
2.  mtcp_restart loads into memory original libmtcp.so from FILE.mtcp
	along with entry point:
		restore_start (a pointer to libmtcp.so:mtcp_restore_start)
    [Also read finishrestore pointer from FILE.mtcp for later use.
     Couldn't we have just saved the pointer in libmtcp.so ??]
3.a.  Call restore_start (now inside libmtcp.so in file mtcp.c)
3.b.  Switch to new stack; (can't even use local vars until in new callframe)
3.c.  If tracing within gdb, set breakpoint to after this callframe, or
	gdb will be very confused.
4.  Switch to restoreverything (now inside libmtcp.so
		in file mtcp_restart_nolibc.c; can again use local vars)
5.  Unmap all other memory regions (except vdso and vsyscall, which belong
	to the kernel); Not allowed to use libc.so at this point
    (We had to switch to another temporary stack in libmtcp.so before
      making any function calls, since mtcp_restart's stack is now gone.)
6.  Map remaining memory regions from FILE.mtcp (libmtcp.so already mapped in)
7.  Now switch back to function finishrestore in file mtcp.c in libmtcp.so .
	Use pointer to finishrestore pointer as entry point.  Don't
	depend on the linker between files being functional yet.
8.  Set stack pointer (%esp/%rsp) to the stack pointer that we saved
	prior to checkpoint.  (Currently save old stack pointer - 128
	as red zone.)
9.  Call restarthread(motherofall).  motherofall is the original user thread.
	It is usually different from the checkpoint thread.  Tell kernel
	to set our thread state to same parameters that we had saved
	pre-checkpoint.
10. Create user threads and have them also call restarthread w/ red zone
	(extended stack pointer), etc.
11. Checkpoint thread now calls siglongjmp()/setcontext() to fully return
	to pre-checkpoint state.  We are now using our pre-checkpoint stack
	instead of the temporary stack.
12. We (the checkpoint thread) are now returning from sigsetjmp()/getcontext()
	in checkpointhread().  Wait for user threads to be restored.
	Execute mtcpHookRestart just before unlocking user threads.  Then
	sleep again until next checkpoint.
	Note that checkpointhread serves two purposes, since it's also the
	original start function from when the checkpoint thread was created.
13. The user thread returns from sigsetjmp()/getcontext() in stopthisthread()
	[Better name might be:  stopthisuserthread().]

RESTART: Details
	    CAN USE CURRENT libc.so AT THIS POINT:
            mtcp_restart.c:main restores old libmtcp.so from checkpoint file.
            mtcp_restart.c:main calls libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):mtcp_restore_start
               via an absolute memory address saved in the checkpoint file.
	    [ If executing under gdb, it will stop with suggested
	      add-symbol-file ... command for gdb.
	      Paste it into gdb to see stack (doesn't always work). ]
            We are now executing inside libmtcp.so, and will never again
               use mtcp_restart.c.
            libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):mtcp_restore_start then sets the stack pointer
	       esp/rsp to a tempstack in libmtcp.so of length only 1024 long
	       (raise this if needed!) and sets ebp/rbp to 0, and then calls
               libmtcp.so(mtcp_restart_nolibc.c):mtcp_restoreverything.
	       [ mtcp_restore_start will never execute again. ]

	    libmtcp.so(mtcp_restart_nolibc.c): CAN'T USE ANY libc.so AT
	    				       THIS POINT
	    CAN NOT USE OLD STACK, AND ABOUT TO ALSO REMOVE OLD HEAP.
            Within mtcp_restoreverything, we unmap all other memory segments
                except libmtcp.so;  So, libc.so is no longer available.
            All code within mtcp_restart_nolibc.c must follow the discipline of
                not using libc.so. It either directly makes syscalls to kernel,
                or else duplicates logic of simple libc.so functions.
            mtcp_restoreverything then restores file descriptors and
                loads memory segments of checkpointed application.
            mtcp_restoreverything then calls libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):finishrestore
                via absolute memory address saved in the checkpoint file.
                [ IS IT NECESSARY TO USE ABSOLUTE MEMORY ADDRESS IF
                  WE DECLARE finishrestore TO HAVE
                   __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))? ]

	   libmtcp.so(mtcp.c): CAN NOW USE OLD CHECKPOINTED libc.so
	   		        AT THIS POINT:
           libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):finishrestore then restores
	   			the original application
                stack pointer and calls restart_thread(motherofall).
           libmtcp.so(mtcp.c):restarthread then restores our thread manager
                (motherofall), followed by the application threads.
                It does so by calling restore_tls_state() for each thread?.
           It then calls siglongjmp/setcontext, to restore the registers and signals
		at the point of checkpointing (process-wide, not per thread)

	  [ A better name for mtcp.c might be to break it up into:
            mtcp_checkpoint.c and mtcp_restart_threads.c. ]

mtcp_restart.c:main():
  reads the address of the mtcp_restore_start function from the checkpoint file, and  (It was saved there at checkpoint time).
  then calls that address at the end of its main, just after restoring
  the checkpoint file into memory.
  The function pointer is called restore_start in main(), and
	corresponds to mtcp_restore_start in mtcp.c.
  Note that we are then in the restored libmtcp.so.  We never again execute
	any code from mtcp_restart.c.

==========================================================================
Linux threads:

Recall that a Linux thread is essentially a process with some special flags
and fields.  pthread_create calls clone to create it.  A thread has both
a tid (thread ID) and pid (process ID).

In __i386__, the segment register %gs is used as a base for addresses in
thread_private data.  It is written %gs:ADDR in assembly, where ADDR is any
assembly address.  In __x86_64__, one uses %fs instead of %gs (and %gs
used for what in __x76_64__?).  Because segment registers are bound to
a particular CPU, distinct CPUs can have different values for %gs.
So one can call the identical code with %gs:ADDR
and in fact address distinct thread-local data, without even knowing
on what CPU you were executing.

Presumably, a context switch will also change the segment registers
appropriately, thus allowing distinct threads on the same CPU to access
distinct thread-local data.

The MTCP data structure, Thread, keeps information about the kernel
state of the thread.  It is used to restore the original state.

As stated in man set_tid_address,
 The  kernel  keeps for each process two values called set_child_tid and
 clear_child_tid that are NULL by default.


Some details to be aware of:
clone allows 6 arguments if called via syscall.
The three extra ones are:
  int *parent_tidptr -- set tid of child in parent and child memory if flag set
  struct user_desc * newtls -- set new Thread Local Storage descriptor
  	The kernel keeps up to three TLS descriptors
	  ([GDT_ENTRY_TLS_MIN..GDT_ENTRY_TLS_MAX]), that are stored
		in the kernel in the tls_array of the current process.
        Apparently, newer Linuxes use only the first TLS descriptor.
	See /usr/include/asm/segment.h for values of GDT_ENTRY_TLS_MIN, etc.
	In __i386__, one can call get_thread_area/set_thread_area to
		read and change this.
  int *child_tidptr -- set tid of child in child memory if flag set

Restoring a thread is a matter of:
 restarthread:
  set_thread_area()
  asm volatile ("movw %0,%%fs" : : "m" (thisthread -> fs));
  asm volatile ("movw %0,%%gs" : : "m" (thisthread -> gs));
  thisthread -> tid = mtcp_sys_kernel_gettid ();
  [ THIS MEANS THAT WE DON'T VIRTUALIZE tid's AND SO RESTORED THREAD
    SEE DIFFERENT tid.  WE STILL NEED TO FIX THIS.  IN PARTICULAR, SUPPOSE
    ONE TRIES TO USE THE tid CREATED BY pthread_create. ]

tid or "thread_t th" is used by:
extern int pthread_create (pthread_t *__restrict __threadp,
extern pthread_t pthread_self (void) __THROW;
extern int pthread_equal (pthread_t __thread1, pthread_t __thread2) __THROW;
extern int pthread_join (pthread_t __th, void **__thread_return);
extern int pthread_detach (pthread_t __th) __THROW;

extern int pthread_cancel (pthread_t __cancelthread);
extern void pthread_testcancel (void);
extern int pthread_getcpuclockid (pthread_t __thread_id,
