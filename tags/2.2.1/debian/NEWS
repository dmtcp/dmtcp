dmtcp (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    libdmtcpaware was deprecated in 2.0 released and completely removed in the
    2.1 release. The corresponding packages are thus removed. Similarly,
    libmtcp has been removed. The functionality was merged in the core DMTCP
    package.  dmtcp_checkpoint is deprecated in favor of dmtcp_launch.

    Pick manpages and docs from the installed location. Removed dmtcp.manpages
    and doc files and incorporated the changes into dmtcp.install file.
