Directory layout:
 - subdirectories: dmtcp and mtcp : will eventually be combined into
   	a future top-level 'src' subdirectory
 - bin : DMTCP binaries (dmtcp_launch, dmtcp_restart, dmtcp_coordinator, etc.)
 - lib : DMTCP internal libraries, including internal plugins that are
        not exposed to the end user.
 - test : Used by 'make check'
 - plugin : (top-level directory of optional plugins; they must be
             invoked by a command line flag of 'dmtcp_launch')
 - doc : Random documentation on aspects of the DMTCP design
         Note especially:  doc/plugin-tutorial.pdf
 - include : Contains dmtcp.h ; useful for third-party plugins
 - contrib : Contributed plugins and other addons.  The more popular ones
             will eventually be migrated to the top-level plugin directory
             as they become mature;  Contrib plugins are not built by default
 - util : random utilities useful mostly for experts
