Many people have contributed code included in the DMTCP distribution.  To show
our appreciation for their public spirit, we list here a condensed list of
their largest contributions in a somewhat chronological order.
Conceptually, DMTCP evolved in three generations:
* MTCP (single process)
* DMTCP (version 1; monolithic)
* DMTCP (version 2; plugins, adaptibility, extensibility)

Michael Rieker <mrieker@nii.net>
    MTCP:  Original author of MTCP (Multi-Threaded CheckPointing)
    software. MTCP was the base layer for supporting single process
    checkpointing.

A distributed layer (DMTCP) was added later to support distributed
processes. Most of MTCP has now been incorporated into the higher layer
and as of the DMTCP-2.2 release, it no longer exists in its original form.

Jason Ansel <jansel@csail.mit.edu>
    DMTCP:  Wrote the original distributed layer of DMTCP, which added
    support for sockets, etc. using the dmtcp_coordinator.  Jason also
    contributed the jalib utilities.  This was the first version of
    DMTCP able to checkpoint MPI.

Gene Cooperman <gene@ccs.neu.edu>
    As leader of the DMTCP project, Gene tries to review and maintain
    the overall architecture, and take special responsibility for
    extending the lower layers:  MTCP, ARM port, etc.

Kapil Arya <kapil@ccs.neu.edu>
    DMTCP version 2:  Authoer of the plugin architecture, without which
    DMTCP would have collapsed under the weight of contributions of
    successive waves of students.

Artem Polyakov <artpol@gmail.com>
    HPC:  developed HBICT project for differential checkpointing (with
    delta-compression) on top of DMTCP.  Contributed and currently
    maintains the batch-queue plugin to work with MPI.

Ana-Maria Visan <anamaria.visan@gmail.com>
    PTRACE:  Added support for checkpointing the ptrace system call,
    allowing DMTCP to checkpoint GDB.  Later, Kapil revised the code
    in order to incorporate it into the ptrace plugin.

Tyler Denniston <tyler@csail.mit.edu>
    Original author of the record-replay plugin that is used by FReD.

Greg Kerr <kerrgi@gmail.com>
    Author of the initial InfiniBand plugin as a proof of principle.

Jiajun Cao <jiajun@ccs.neu.edu>
    Extended the InfiniBand plugin into robust code suitable for
    use with MPI.  Currently examining support for the Intel Xeon Phi.

Rohan Garg <rohgarg@ccs.neu.edu>
    Wrote KVM and Tun/Tap plugins to checkpoint a network of KVM virtual
    machines.

Others who either directly contributed code to DMTCP, or contributed an
off-line proof of principle (in alphabetical order):
 * Alex Brick
 * Kito Cheng (adaptation to Android)
 * Jim Huang (adaptation to Android)
 * Zhengping Jin
 * Samaneh Kazemi Nafchi
 * Komal Sodha
 * Praveen Singh Solanki
