This directory contains some useful scripts to work with DMTCP on clusters.
This directory is becoming somewhat crowded, but some particularly useful
utilities to highlight are:

* readdmtcp.sh - read the memory map of a DMTCP checkpoint image (ckpt_*.dmtcp)
* git-bisect.sh - a template for doing 'git bisect run ./git-bisect.sh'
			tests on the DMTCP revision history in git
* gdb-add-symbol-file - After DMTCP restart, the debug symbol information
			for a library in memory may no longer be available,
			since the in-memory copy was restored rather than
			loaded from the library on disk.  This allows you
			to recover debugging symbol information on that library.
[ Contributors:  please add to this list, above. ]

OLD TEXT:
It also contains gdb-add-symbol-file.  Execute it with no arguments
  for instructions on its usage.  It loads library debugging symbols
  into gdb that might not otherwise be there, such as libc-2.7.so.
