# pathvirt (Path Virtualization DMTCP Plugin)

pathvirt is a DMTCP plugin that virtualizes access to file system paths for
programs run under DMTCP. This allows path access to be transparently
redirected elsewhere on the file system on DMTCP restart.

## Usage

pathvirt operates on the basis of path prefixes and is interfaced with using
the DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX environment variable.

On DMTCP init, set DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX to a colon delimited list of path
prefixes to register them with pathvirt. This is required, but does not
actually change anything about the execution of the program until the first
restart. For example:

    $ DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX=/home/user1/bin1:/home/user1/lib1:/home/user1/doc1 \
        dmtcp_launch -i4 --with-plugin $DMTCP_ROOT/lib/dmtcp/libdmtcp_pathvirt.so \
        ./my-program

Then, on any DMTCP restart, you can optionally set DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX to a
second colon delimited list of path prefixes. For example:

    $ DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX=/home/user2/bin2:/home/user2/lib2:/home/user2/doc2 \
        ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh
        
If you *do not* provide DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX on restart, pathvirt does nothing,
and the program is restarted from the last checkpoint as normal.

If you *do* provide it, pathvirt becomes active and starts performing path
translation.  At this point, prefixes in this second list will dynamically
replace corresponding prefixes in the first list when a program uses a path
that is prefixed with an entry in the first colon list. For example:

    open("/home/user1/bin1/ls") => open("/home/user2/bin2/ls")
    open("/home/user1/lib1/libc.so.6") => open("/home/user2/lib2/libc.so.6")
    open("/home/user1/doc1/proj/README") => open("/home/user2/doc2/proj/README")
    open("/not/registered/prefix.txt") => open("/not/registered/prefix.txt")

## Constraints

- The maximum size permitted for the DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX environment variable is
  10*1024 bytes at time of writing. This configuration can be increased by
  editing `plugin/pathvirt/pathvirt.cpp:MAX_ENV_VAR_SIZE` and recompiling.
- DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX is also constrained by a DMTCP environment variable
  limit of 12*1024 bytes at time of writing. This configuration can be
  increased by editing `src/dmtcpplugin.cpp:MAXSIZE` and recompiling.

## Development

### Testing

To run a basic test, cd into plugin/pathvirt/test/slot5.

    make check
    *** wait for a checkpoint, then ctrl-c ***
    make restart
    *** wait for a checkpoint, then ctrl-c ***
    make test

You should observe that on launch, the slot5/***5/pv-test.txt files were being
written to, but after restart the ../misc/slot7/***7/pv-test.txt files were
being written to.
