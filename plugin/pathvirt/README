# Path Virtualization DMTCP Plugin

by Mark Mossberg

## testing

You may need to edit the PATHVIRT variable in the Makefile within the slot5/
directory to correct the paths to the pathvirt directory.

To run a basic test, run the following:

make
cd slot5
make check
*** wait for a checkpoint, then ctrl-c ***
make restart
*** wait for a checkpoint, then ctrl-c ***
make test

You should observe that on launch, the slot5/***5/pv-test.txt files were being
written to, but after restart the ../misc/slot7/***7/pv-test.txt files were
being written to.

## overview

- pathvirt.c is a DMTCP plugin that allows colon delimited path lists to be
  registered with it via the DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX environment variable
- the plugin records the list of paths that should be swapped out in the
  future into an internal buffer on launch
- on restart, a new colon list of path prefixes are given, and the plugin's
  libc hooks become active (currently only implemented for open and fopen64).
  Any attempt to call a libc function on a previously registered path will
  result in a new path being created with the old path prefix replaced by the
  newly given one and the call forwarded on.

  This flexibly allows path access to be redirected based on the conditions
  the process is being restarted in.

## constraints

- due to a current limitation of dmtcp_get_restart_env(), the maximum length of
  the colon lists that can be provided via the DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX variable
  is 2982 bytes. This is because the maximum size of the name=value
  string is 3000 bytes and "DMTCP_PATH_PREFIX=" occupies 18 of those. If
  a environment variable that exceeds these limits is provided, it will be
  truncated.
