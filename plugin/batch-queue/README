General support for cluster resource managers (RM) is provided.
The two names for this plugin (batch-queue and "rm") are synonyms.

Instead of using this plugin directly, please read USAGE EXAMPLES below.

A single plugin, libdmtcp_rm.so, supports several resource mangers.
To invoke this plugin, you should only need to use the flag '--rm':
  dmtcp_launch --rm MYAPP ARG1 ...

Currently the TORQUE and SLURM resource managers are supported.
Support for SGE and LSF is planned for the near future.

Torque is still under testing.  If you have problems with it, please write
to the authors.

Also, SLURM _especially_ is new code.  It works on most clusters, but
we have not done enough testing on the variety of clusters available.
There may still be some smaller bugs.  Please help us by sending feedback
to the authors.  Such bugs will be fixed as we discover them.

USAGE EXAMPLES: 
  To enable the DMTCP RM module you need to use the --rm option in
  dmtcp_launch.  
  Sample scripts are located in: <dmtcp-topdir>/plugin/batch-queue/job_examples.
  The examples aim to be self-descriptive.
      During debugging, it is better to start the dmtcp_coordinator in an
  interactive terminal on the front end.  Refer to the example batch script
  (with its comment in the start_coordinator() function).
