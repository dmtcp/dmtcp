/* Update by Kapil Arya to create the Torque DMTCP plugin. */

/* The Torque PBS resource manager supporting code.

   Torque PBS contains the libtorque library, which provides the API for
   communications with the MOM Node management servers.  The library obtains
   information about the allocated resources and uses it.  In particular the
   spawn programs on the remote nodes use tm_spawn.

   To keep track of and control all processes spawned using any method (such as
   exec, ssh), we also need to wrap the tm_spawn function.
