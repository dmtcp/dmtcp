# [DMTCP: Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing](http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmtcp/dmtcp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmtcp/dmtcp)

DMTCP is a tool to transparently checkpoint the state of multiple simultaneous
applications, including multi-threaded and distributed applications. It
operates directly on the user binary executable, without any Linux kernel
modules or other kernel modifications.

Among the applications supported by DMTCP are MPI (various implementations),
OpenMP, MATLAB, Python, Perl, R, and many programming languages and shell
scripting languages. DMTCP also supports GNU screen sessions, including
vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of TightVNC, it can also checkpoint
and restart X Window applications.  The OpenGL library for 3D graphics
is supported through a special plugin.

DMTCP supports the commonly used OFED API for InfiniBand, as well as its
integration with various implementations of MPI, and resource managers
(e.g., SLURM).

To install DMTCP, see the file: `INSTALL`.

For an overview DMTCP, see the file: `QUICK-START`.

For the license, see the file: `COPYING`.

Directory layout:
 - src : DMTCP source code.
 - src/plugin : source for DMTCP internal plugins.
 - jalib : small pkg used by DMTCP for assertions, warnings, tracing code, etc.
 - bin : DMTCP binaries (`dmtcp_launch`, `dmtcp_restart`, `dmtcp_coordinator`, etc.)
 - lib : DMTCP internal libraries, including internal plugins that are
        not exposed to the end user.
 - test : Used by 'make check'
 - test/plugin : Simple examples for learning DMTCP plugins
 - plugin : (top-level directory of optional plugins; they must be
             invoked by a command line flag of `dmtcp_launch`)
 - doc : Random documentation on aspects of the DMTCP design
         Note especially:  doc/plugin-tutorial.pdf
 - include : Contains dmtcp.h ; useful for third-party plugins
 - contrib : Contributed plugins and other add-ons.  The more popular ones
             will eventually be migrated to the top-level plugin directory
             as they become mature;  Contrib plugins are not built by default.
 - util : random utilities, useful mostly for experts
