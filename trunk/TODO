Known issues/bugs:
1) brk(saved_brk) crashes dmtcp_restart of mpd on teracluster
    Should brk() be called before or after restoring memory?  Is it needed at all?
2) "mtcp_restore: error 16 mapping 2000 bytes at 0x7FBFFFE000" happens when restarting testmtcp on teracluster
    It seems to work... but what is causing this error
    Similar errors occur with all the other progs I tested.
3) mtcp only compiles with "-O0" on teracluster, fails with -O{1,2,3}, is this unavoidable?
4) MPICH2 failes after restart when debug printing is enabled in mtcp.  It works if you disabled DPRINTF.
5) OpenMPI fails to checkpoint/restore
6) Many fcntl()/ioctl() flags are not checkpointed
7) Fifos/pts/ttys are not handled correctly
