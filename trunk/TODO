x) `yes | ./mtcp_restore testmtcp.mtcp` will crash after 30 sec on kleptocracy
x) testmtcp5.c gives unexpected results

2) "mtcp_restore: error 16 mapping 2000 bytes at 0x7FBFFFE000" happens when restarting testmtcp on teracluster
    It seems to work... but what is causing this error
3) mtcp only compiles with "-O0" on teracluster, fails with -O{1,2,3}, is this unavoidable?
4) MPICH2 failes after restart when debug printing is enabled in mtcp.  It works if you disabled DPRINTF.
5) OpenMPI fails to checkpoint/restore
6) Many fcntl()/ioctl() flags are not checkpointed
7) Fifos/pts/ttys are not handled correctly
