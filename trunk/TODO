- MTCP fails latest debian glibc version 2.7-12

- setsighandler fails if user has reset our signal handler
  Do we cleanly tell the user what signal is being used by app,
  and to reurn dmtcp with --sigckpt  set to other signal?

- Would like to get ParGAP or even nested shells to work with
  checkpointing.  I believe the issue here was pseudo-ttys,
  if I remember.  This seems to be related to the issue that sometimes
  upon restart, a process tries to write to its old stdout, which
  can be an xterm that no longer exists.  It is also related to
  what happens to stdin.  I think this is the part that Jason had said
  he could eventually get to.

- Extend list of syscalls using netdb to put wrappers around them.
  The danger is that in invoking the netdb, they might want to
  create a socket.  Then we detect this, and we try to create
  a socket to the coordinator.  This hits our wrapper function, which
  then creates an infinite loop.  At least, we think we saw this in
  Ubuntu 6.06 (dapper).
          
- Many more exotic fcntl()/ioctl() flags are not checkpointed

- Fifos are not handled correctly, do any apps use them?
