MINOR CLEANUP:

2.  dmtcp_coordinator should accept "q" for quit.
    dmtcp_coordinator should accept "h" and "?" for help.  [DONE]
3.  dmtcp_checkpoint should have flag:  --sigckpt SIGNAL_NUMBER
      kill -l    shows signals and corresponding signal numbers.
      Probably it should also print initial banner saying that
        restart script will be created in:  dmtcp_restart_script.sh
    [ Does:   dmtcp_checkpoint -h       work?]
4.  setsighandler fails if user has reset our signal handler
    Do we cleanly tell the user what signal is being used by app,
    and to reurn dmtcp with --sigckpt  set to other signal?
4.b. DMTCP uses ENV_VAR_XXX for its environment variables.
     A name like DMTCP_XXX is probably more appropriate.

HARDER THINGS:
5.  Would like to get ParGAP or even nested shells to work with
        checkpointing.  I believe the issue here was pseudo-ttys,
        if I remember.  This seems to be related to the issue that sometimes
        upon restart, a process tries to write to its old stdout, which
        can be an xterm that no longer exists.  It is also related to
        what happens to stdin.  I think this is the part that Jason had said
        he could eventually get to.
6.  Diagnose why OpenMPI is failing.  I have two interested M.S. students
        in my parallel computing course.  Hopefully, they will give
        us the diagnosis.  In this case, processes were exiting prematurely,
        and then there was only a single process left trying to checkpoint.
7.  Extend list of syscalls using netdb to put wrappers around them.
	The danger is that in invoking the netdb, they might want to
	create a socket.  Then we detect this, and we try to create
	a socket to the coordinator.  This hits our wrapper function, which
	then creates an infinite loop.  At least, we think we saw this in
	Ubuntu 6.06 (dapper).
        
        
OLDER THINGS:

x) new test testmtcp5.c gives unexpected results
x) "ssh X" seems to setup sockets for stdin/stdout of X... this causing pain 
x) [d]mtcp seems to be pooping out files named "socket:[12345]"... why???

2) "mtcp_restart: error 16 mapping 2000 bytes at 0x7FBFFFE000" happens when restarting testmtcp on teracluster
    It seems to work... but what is causing this error?
3) mtcp only compiles with "-O0" on teracluster, fails with -O{1,2,3}, is this unavoidable?
4) MPICH2 failes after restart when debug printing is enabled in mtcp.  It works if you disabled DPRINTF.
5) OpenMPI fails to checkpoint/restore
6) Many fcntl()/ioctl() flags are not checkpointed
7) Fifos/pts/ttys are not handled correctly
