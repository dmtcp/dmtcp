Prints time before and after sleep() with approximately millisecond accuracy.
This demonstrates wrappers around wrappers.  The module ../sleep1 wraps
  this module sleep2, which wraps sleep() in libc.so
To demonstrate, do:  make check    [Checkpoints every 5 seconds]
After killing it, try:  ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh
