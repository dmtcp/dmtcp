The modules in these subdirectories are intended as simple examples.
To try MODULE, do:  cd MODULE; make check
After killing process, try:  ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh

example:  how to react to special events (init, ckpt, resume, restart, ...)
sleep1:  wrapper around sleep() in program ../../test/dmtcp1
         (displays seconds and microseconds, before and after sleep())
sleep2:  second wrapper around sleep() in program ../../test/dmtcp1
	'make check' invokes both wrappers simultaneously.
