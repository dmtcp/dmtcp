Description: Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing
 DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool to transparently
 checkpointing the state of an arbitrary group of programs spread across many
 machines and connected by sockets. It runs directly on the user binary
 executable, without needing to modify either the user binary or the operating
 system.
 .
 Among the applications supported by DMTCP are OpenMPI, MATLAB, Python,
 Perl, and many programming languages and shell scripting languages.
 Starting with release 1.2.0, DMTCP also supports GNU screen sessions,
 including vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of TightVNC, it can also
 checkpoint and restart X-Windows applications, as long as they do not
 use extensions (e.g.: no OpenGL, no video).
