On restart, read dmtcp_env.txt and modify the process's environment accordingly.
The file, dmtcp_env.txt, must be in the same checkpoint directory as
  the checkpoint image files, ckpt_*.dmtcp .
To demonstrate, do:  make check
After killing it, try:
  ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh
  # suspend
  # Currently, /proc/*/environ is empty for mtcp_restart;
  #   We will fix this in DMTCP in a future version, and then:
  cat /proc/`pgrep -n mtcp_restart`/environ | tr '\0' '\n'
