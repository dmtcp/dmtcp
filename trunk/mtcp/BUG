We try to re-open /proc/self/fd/1, etc., which is /dev/pts/1, etc.
However, in a multi-user system, /dev/pts/1 may now be owned by someone
else.  So, we should try to open /dev/tty or something instead.

At least, in Linux, when the X-windows session was owned by one user,
and I had opened an xterm, and done an su to myself, the other user
still owned /dev/pts/1, and I couldn't access it.

MTCP is broken on empire.bean-o.com (glibc 2.3.6.ds1-4; linux 2.6.18-k8-smp; jansel@ccs.neu.edu for access)
 -checkpointing in testmtcp2 is broken
 -restore in testmtcp{1,3,4} is broken
