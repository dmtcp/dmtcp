\maketitle

This is intended as a gentle introduction to the architecture of DMTCP.
Shorter descriptions are possible.

\subsection*{1. Usage:}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE {\tt dmtcp\_checkpoint a.out}
\STATE {\tt dmtcp\_command --checkpoint} \newline
\hbox{\ \ \ \ } $\hookrightarrow$ ckpt\_a.out.*.dmtcp
\STATE {\tt dmtcp\_restart ckpt\_a.out.*.dmtcp}
\end{algorithmic}

\bigskip
\noindent
DMTCP offers a {\tt --help} command line option along with additional options
both for {\tt configure} and for the individual DMTCP commands.
To use DMTCP, just prefix your command line with {\tt dmtcp\_checkpoint}.

\subsection*{2. dmtcp\_checkpoint a.out}

The command {\tt dmtcp\_checkpoint a.out} is roughly equivalent to:

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE {\tt dmtcp\_coordinator --background}  (if not already running)
\STATE {\tt LD\_PRELOAD=dmtcphijack.so a.out}
\end{algorithmic}

The {\tt dmtcp\_checkpoint} command will cause a coordinator process
to be launched on the local host with the default DMTCP port (if one is
not already available).

DMTCP implements a coordinator process because DMTCP can also checkpoint
distributed computations across many computers.  The user can issue a command
to the coordinator, which will then relay the command to each of
the user processes of the distributed computation.

Note that a {\em DMTCP computation} is defined to be a coordinator process
and the set of user processes connected to that coordinator.  Therefore,
one can have more than one DMTCP computation on a single computer,
each computation having its own unique coordinator.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{coord-client.eps}
\end{center}

The coordinator is {\em stateless}.  If the computation is ever killed,
one needs only to start an entirely new coordinator, and then restart
using the latest checkpoint images for each user process.

LD\_PRELOAD is a special environment variable known to the loader.
When the loader tries to load a binary (a.out, in this case), the loader
will first check if LD\_PRELOAD is set (see `man ld.so').  If it is
set, the loader will load the binary (a.out) and then the preload library
(dmtcphijack.so) before running the `main()' routine in a.out.

When the library dmtcphijack.so is loaded, any top-level variables
are initialized, before calling the user main().  If the top-level variable
is a C++ object, then the C++ constructor is called before the
user main.  In DMTCP, the first code to execute is the code
below, inside dmtcphijack.so:

{\tt
dmtcp::DmtcpWorker dmtcp::DmtcpWorker::theInstance ( true );
}

This initializes the global variable, {\tt theInstance} via a call
to {\tt new dmtcp::DmtcpWorker::DmtcpWorker(true)}.  (Here, {\tt dmtcp}
is a C++ namespace, and the first {\tt DmtcpWorker} is the class name,
while the second {\tt DmtcpWorker} is the constructor function.  If DMTCP were
not using C++, then it would use a direct way to use GNU gcc attributes
to directly run a constructor function.)

Note that DMTCP is organized in at least two layers.  The lowest layer
is MTCP (mtcp subdirectory), which handles single-process checkpointing.
The higher layer is again called DMTCP (dmtcp subdirectory), and delegates
to MTCP when it needs to checkpoint one process.  MTCP does not require
a separate DMTCP coordinator.

So, at startup, we see:

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE a.out process:
\STATE {\ \ } primary user thread:
\STATE {\ \ \ \ } new DmtcpWorker(true):
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Create a socket to the coordinator
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Register the signal handler that will be
	used for checkpoints. \newline
\hbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } The signal handler is
		 mtcp/mtcp.c:stopthisthread()\newline
\hbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } The default signal is STOPSIGNAL
		 (default: SIGUSR2)\newline
\hbox{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } The signal handler is registered by
	 {\tt mtcp\_sigaction(STOPSIGNAL, \&act, \&old\_act)} in mtcp/mtcp.c
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Create the checkpoint thread
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Call
	{\tt pthread\_create (\&checkpointhreadid, NULL, checkpointhread, NULL)}
	in mtcp/mtcp.c
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Wait until the checkpoint thread has initialized.
\newline
\STATE {\ \ } checkpoint thread:
\STATE {\ \ \ \ } checkpointhread(dummy):  [from mtcp/mtcp.c]
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Register a.out process with coordinator
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Tell user thread we're done
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Call select() on socket to coordinator
\newline
\STATE {\ \ } checkpoint thread:
\STATE {\ \ \ \ } new DmtcpWorker(true):  [continued from above invocation]
\STATE {\ \ \ \ \ \ } Checkpoint thread is now initialized.  Return.
\newline
\STATE {\ \ } user thread:
\STATE {\ \ \ \ } main()  [User code now executes.]
\end{algorithmic}

\bigskip
\noindent
PRINCIPLE:  At any given moment either the user threads are active and
	the checkpoint thread is blocked on {\tt select()}, or
	the checkpoint thread is active and the user threads are
	blocked inside the signal handler, stopthisthread().

\subsection*{3. Execute a Checkpoint:}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dmtcp-ckpt.eps}
\end{center}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE checkpoint thread:
\STATE   return from select()
\STATE   receive CKPT message
\STATE   send STOPSIGNAL (SIGUSR2) to each user thread
\STATE      See:  retval = mtcp\_sys\_kernel\_tgkill(motherpid, thread->tid, STOPSIGNAL);
		in mtcp/mtcp.c
  See {\tt mtcp\_state\_set (\&(thread -> state), ST\_SUSPINPROG, ST\_SIGENABLED)}
   and {\tt mtcp\_state\_set (\&(thread -> state), ST\_SUSPENDED, ST\_SUSPINPROG)}
	in mtcp/mtcp.c
\STATE   {\tt mtcp\_state\_set(MtcpState * state, int value, int oldval)}
	is defined in mtcp/mtcp\_state.c, and does its work through
	a Linux per-thread futex (similar to a mutex).
\STATE   [Recall that dmtcpWorker created a signal handler, STOPSIGNAL (default: SIGUSR2)
\STATE   Each user thread in the signal handler for STOPSIGNAL will block on
	the per-thread futex.
\STATE   The checkpoint thread does the cehckpoint.
\newline
\STATE   Release each thread from its per-thread futex.
    See {\tt mtcp\_state\_set (\&(thread -> state), ST\_RUNENABLED, ST\_SUSPENDED)}
	in mtcp/mtcp.c
\STATE   Call select() on the socket to the coordinator and again wait for
	messages from the coordinator.
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection*{4. Checkpoint strategy (overview)}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Quiesce all user threads (using STOPSIGNAL (SIGUSR2), as above)
\STATE Drain sockets \newline
  \hbox{\ \ } (a) Sender sends a ``cookie'' \newline
  \hbox{\ \ } (b) Receiver receives until it sees the ``cookie'' \newline
  Note:  Usually all sockets are ``internal'' --- within the current
    computation.  Heuristics are provided for the case of ``external'' sockets.
\STATE Interrogate kernel state (open file descriptors, file descriptor offset, etc.)
\STATE Save register values using setcontext (similar to setjmp) in mtcp/mtcp.c
\STATE Copy all user-space memory to checkpoint image
  To find all user-space memory, one can execute: \newline
  \hbox{\ \ } {\tt cat /proc/self/maps}
\STATE Unblock all use threads
\end{algorithmic}

\newpage

\subsection*{5. Principle:  DMTCP is contagious}

New Linux ``tasks'' are created in one of three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item new thread: created by pthread\_create() or clone()
  \item new process: created by fork()
  \item new remote process: typically created by the `system' system call: \\
	{\tt system("ssh REMOTE\_HOST a.out");}
\end{enumerate}

DMTCP makes sure to load itself using wrapper functions.

\subsection*{6. Wrapper functions}

Wrapper functions are functions around functions.  DMTCP creates
functions around libc.so functions.
Wrapper functions
are typically created using dlopen/dlsym.  For example, to define
a wrapper around libc:fork(), one defines a function fork()
in dmtcphijack.so (see {\tt extern "C" pid\_t fork()} in execwrappers.cpp).

Continuing this example, if the user code calls fork(), then we see
the following progression.

a.out:call to fork() $\longrightarrow$ dmtcphijack.so:fork() $\longrightarrow$ libc.so:fork()

The symbol dmtcphijack.so:fork appears before libc.so:fork in the
library search order because dmtcphijack.so was loaded before libc.so
(due to LD\_PRELOAD).

Next, the wrapper around {\tt pthread\_create} remembers the thread id
of the new thread created.  The wrapper around {\tt fork} ensures
that the environment variable LD\_PRELOAD is still set to dmtcphijack.so.
If LD\_PRELOAD does not currently include dmtcphijack.so, then it is
reset to include dmtcphijack.so before the call to fork(), and then
LD\_PRELOAD is reset to the original user value after fork().

The wrapper around {\tt system} (in the case of creating remote processes)
is perhaps the most interesting one.  See {\tt `man system'} for a description
of the call {\tt system}.  It looks at an argument, for example
{\tt "ssh REMOTE\_HOST a.out"}, and then edits the argument to
{\tt "ssh REMOTE\_HOST dmtcp\_checkpoint a.out"} before calling {\tt system}.
Of course, this works only if dmtcp\_checkpoint is in the user's path
on {\tt REMOTE\_HOST}.  This is the responsibility of the user or the
system administrator.

\subsection*{7. PID/TID Virtualization}

Any system calls that refer to a process id (pid) or thread id (tid) requires
a wrapper.  DMTCP then translates between a virtual pid/tid an the
real pid/tid.  The user code always sees the virtual pid/tid, while
the kernel always sees the real pid/tid.

\newpage

\subsection*{8. Modules, Dmtcpaware, and other End-User Customizations}

DMTCP offers a rich set of features for customizing the behavior of
DMTCP.  In this short overview, we will point to examples that can
easily be modified by an end-user.

\paragraph{DMTCP Modules.}

{\em DMTCP modules\/} are the most general way to customize DMTCP.  Examples
are in {\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/test/module/}.  A dynamic library~({\tt *.so})
file is created to modify the behavior of DMTCP.  The library can
write additional wrapper functions (and even define wrappers around
previous wrapper functions).  The library can also register
to be notified of {\em DMTCP events}.  In this case, DMTCP will
call any module functions registered for each event.
Examples of important events are
\hbox{e.g.}~prior to checkpoint, after resume, and after restart
from a checkpoint image.  As of this writing, there is no central
list of all DMTCP events, and names of events are still subject to change.

Module libraries are preloaded after dmtcphijack.so.  As with all
preloaded libraries, they can initialize themselves before the user's
``main'' function, and at run-time, module wrapper functions will
be found in standard Linux library search order prior to ordinary
library functions in libc.so and elsewhere.

For example, the sleep2 module example uses two modules.  After building
the modules, it might be called as follows: 
{\tt
  dmtcp\_checkpoint --with-module \\ \newline
\hbox{\ \ }
 PATH/sleep1/dmtcp\_sleep1hijack.so:PATH/sleep2/dmtcp\_sleep2hijack.so a.out}
 \newline
where {\tt PATH} is {\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/test/module}

In a more involved example, whenever {\tt ./configure
--enable-ptrace-support} is specified, then DMTCP will use the module
{\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/module/ptrace/ptracehijack.so}.  A new module to
provide PID/TID virtualization is currently planned.  As with support
for ptrace, a more modular structure for PID/TID virtualization will be
easier to maintain.

\paragraph{Dmtcpaware.}

A second customization facility is provided by {\em dmtcpaware}.
This allows an end user to register the three most important events
discussed earlier (pre-checkpoint, post-resume, post-restart).
Dmtcpaware is implemented through the use of {\em weak symbols}.
When weak and ordinary symbols are both defined, a loader will
load an ordinary symbol in preference to a weak symbol of the same name.
If an ordinary symbol is not defined, then the weak symbol will
be loaded.  Hence, a weak symbol is a kind of {\em default definition}
of a symbol.

For further information on the implementation, see the source files,
dmtcpawareapi.cpp, dmtcpaware.c, and dmtcpaware.h in DMTCP\_ROOT/dmtcp/src.

For examples of dmtcpaware programs, see
 {\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/test/dmtcpaware1.c} and similarly for dmtcpaware2.c and
dmtcpaware3.c.  These programs are compiled by linking with\hfil\break
{\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/dmtcpaware/libdmtcpaware.a}~.
They are invoked in the usual way.  For example, \newline
{\tt dmtcp\_checkpoint dmtcpaware1}~.


\paragraph{MTCP.}

For standalone MTCP programs, there is also a mechanism based on
weak symbols.  For an example of its use, see:
{\tt DMTCP\_ROOT/mtcp/testmtcp.c}
