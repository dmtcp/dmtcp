These are simple socket programs that are useful for testing dmtcp.

To run a program with checkpointing:
  1) Run dmtcp_coordinator in a seperate terminal
  2) Replace each command with "dmtcp_checkpoint [command]" 
	IE: dmtcp_checkpoint ./server 12345
  3) To checkpoint type 'c' into dmtcp_coordinator_
NOTE: all these dmtcp_* programs can be found in ../src/ after compilation.

01.echoserver
	./server 12345
	./client localhost 12345

	Input on the client is sent to the server and echoed back.

	This is the simpliest test possible of checkpointing.




02.frisbee
	Forms a circle...
	./player listenPort connectHost connectPort

	./player 9001 localhost 9002
	./player 9002 localhost 9003
	...
	./player ... localhost 9001

	On one client type 'y' to set it as a starter node.  On all other nodes type 'n'.  Entering a char sends that char to the next node in the loop.  Entering 'C' recieves a char from the previos node.

	The point of this test is to make sure dmtcp can handle cycles in the connection graph.  





03.forkexec
	./forkexec

	Input is sent over a socketpair() to a forked child process which prints it to stdout.  

	The point of this test is to make sure dmtcp can handle sockets inherited from a parent process.
