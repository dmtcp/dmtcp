BUILDING

Basic:
$ tar -jxvf dmtcp-X.Y.tar.bz2
$ cd dmtcp
$ ./configure
$ make


With (spammy) debugging traces and debugging symbols:
$ tar -zxvf dmtcp-X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd dmtcp
$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g3" --enable-debug=full
$ make

There is also a "make install" target, which is not yet recommended,
that will copy libdmtcp.a and dmtcp_master to $PREFIX/{lib,bin}.

For (generic) building/install directions see ./INSTALL



IMPORTANT FILES

./mtcp.so          - binary mtcp library, (source in mtcpv62.tar.bz2)
./mtcp_restore     - binary mtcp restore program, (source in mtcpv62.tar.bz2)
./src/dmtcp_master - master server which coordinates checkpoints between nodes
./src/libdmtcp.a   - static library linked into user program






RUNNING A DMTCP ENABLED PROGRAM

First you must run a master server:
$ dmtcp_master [port]
(if left off, port defaults to 7999)

Define environmental variables:
DMTCP_HOST="hostname.of.yourmaster.com"
DMTCP_PORT=7999
(if left off, defaults to localhost:7999)


RESTORING A CHECKPOINT

First you must run a master server:
$ dmtcp_master [port]
(if left off, port defaults to 7999)
Note: Currently master host/port MUST be the same as it was at checkpoint time.


In any order, restore the checkpoints of each node in cluster.  The locations 
of each NODE CAN change, they will use the master server to find the 
new locations of all their peers.

You can restore a single node with a command like this:
$ mtcp_restore cktp-XXXXXXX-YYYY-ZZZZZ.mtcp

Names of checkpoints are cktp-HOSTID-PID-STARTTIME.mtcp. In working directory
of each program.

Once all peers are restarted, cluster-wide execution will automatically restart
checkpoints will start again.
