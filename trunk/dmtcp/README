BUILDING

Basic:
$ tar -jxvf dmtcp-X.Y.tar.bz2
$ cd dmtcp
$ ./configure
$ make


With (spammy) debugging traces and debugging symbols:
$ tar -zxvf dmtcp-X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd dmtcp
$ ./configure CPPFLAGS="-DDEBUG" CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g3" --enable-debug=full
$ make

There is also a "make install" target, which is not yet recommended,
that will copy binaries to $PREFIX/{lib,bin}.

For (generic) building/install directions see ./INSTALL


IMPORTANT PROGRAMS

./src/dmtcp_master      - master server which coordinates checkpoints between nodes (run first)
./src/dmtcp_checkpoint  - wrapper to executate a user program with checkpointing
./src/dmtcp_restart     - utility to restart checkpoint (*.mtcp) files



RUNNING A DMTCP ENABLED PROGRAM

First you must run a master server:
$ dmtcp_master [port]
(if left off, port defaults to 7999)

Define environmental variables:
DMTCP_HOST="hostname.of.yourmaster.com"
DMTCP_PORT=7999
(if left off, defaults to localhost:7999)


Now run the program
$ dmtcp_checkpoint ./a.out 1 2 3 4

Child processes are also checkpointed.  
Calls to "ssh theHost ./a.out 1 2 3" will be transformed to "ssh theHost dmtcp_checkpoint ./a.out 1 2 3"


RESTORING A CHECKPOINT

First you must run a master server:
$ dmtcp_master [port]
(if left off, port defaults to 7999)
Note: Currently master host/port MUST be the same as it was at checkpoint time.

In any order, restore the checkpoints of each node in cluster.  The locations 
of each node CAN change, they will use the master server to find the 
new locations of all their peers.

Currently every process must be restored independently with a command like:
$ dmtcp_restart cktp-XXXXXXX-YYYY-ZZZZZ.mtcp

Names of checkpoints are cktp-HOSTID-PID-STARTTIME.mtcp. In working directory
of each program.

Checkpoints can be restarted in any order, execution will not resume until all peers
have been restarted.

Once all peers are restarted, cluster-wide execution will automatically restart
checkpoints will start again.
